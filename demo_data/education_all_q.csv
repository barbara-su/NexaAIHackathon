Education systems can create a deeper awareness of sustainability, environmental stewardship, and cultural diversity by including indigenous perspectives, traditional ecological knowledge, and cultural heritage in the curriculum. However, traditional cultures often resist modern educational techniques and should be progressively transformed to embrace more innovative approaches. This necessitates interacting with communities, respecting their beliefs, and co-creating educational programmes that bridge the gap between traditional knowledge and modern abilities. Balancing cultural preservation with the learning of contemporary skills is critical for equipping young people to flourish in a fast-changing society.
Need for a comprehensive education reforms
must be comprehensive to address young people's challenges, covering early childhood to higher education and lifelong learning. Early childhood education sets the foundation for future learning and development. Governments should invest in quality early childhood programmes prioritising play-based learning, cognitive development, and social-emotional skills. Primary and secondary education should cultivate critical thinking, creativity, problem-solving, and digital literacy. Assessments should go beyond rote memorisation and standardised testing, encompassing real-world applications and project-based learning. Strategies for educating different age groups must be tailored accordingly, with younger children requiring more playful elements in their education. Furthermore, education systems should be assessed based on the skills possessed by young people. International assessments like the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study
(TIMSS) provide valuable insights into students' proficiency in critical subjects. Policymakers can target resources and support to enhance learning outcomes by identifying areas where interventions are needed.

As industries and job markets evolve, there is a growing demand for a more holistic approach to credentialing. Competency-based assessments, digital badges, and micro-credentials can provide a more nuanced and granular representation
of young people's skills and achievements. This shift towards competency-based education and alternative credentials can bridge the gap between formal education and the skills required by employers.
In conclusion, comprehensive education reforms are necessary to empower youth to overcome these challenges and seize opportunities to advance the SDG 4 targets. Investments in education and skills development, leveraging technology, fostering inclusive and equitable learning environments, and embracing diverse cultural perspectives are crucial to enhancing human capital formation.

"The challenges facing young people today are unprecedented. From lost educational opportunities due to the pandemic-induced lockdowns to the looming climate crisis, dangerous virtual spaces, and concerns over food and energy security triggered by geopolitical conflicts—the hurdles they face are numerous, complex, and interconnected. However, young people worldwide are rising to these challenges, coalescing around issues, and creating innovative solutions that consider diverse cultures, geographies, and development statuses.

|Eastern Europe and Central Asia
|East and South Asia
|Latin America and the Caribbean
|Middle East and North Africa
|Small Island Developing States
Note: The 2023 SDG 4 scores are based on the following indicators:
1. Participation rate in pre-primary organised learning (% of children aged 4 to 6)
2. Net primary enrollment rate (%)
3. Lower secondary completion rate (%)
4. Literacy rate (% of the population aged 15 to 24)
5. Tertiary educational attainment (% of the population aged 25 to 34)
6. PISA score (worst 0-600 best)
7. Variation in science performance explained by socio-economic status (%)
8. Underachievers in science (% of 15-year-olds)
The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted education systems globally, leading to lost school years and increasing educational inequality. It has exacerbated the divide between the Global North and South. As restrictions became widespread, schools had to close, impacting the achievement of SDG 4 targets. However, certain countries could reopen schools earlier due to better health infrastructure and advanced educational facilities. For instance
, children in advanced economies lost an average of 15 school days in 2020. In contrast, the number increased to an average of 45 days for emerging-market economies and a staggering 72 days for children in the poorest nations. Bridging these disparities in educational losses between developed and developing countries has become crucial in the post-pandemic recovery processes, as it determines the long-term macroeconomic structure of the global economies, with youth capital playing a pivotal role.
Technology is a powerful tool for improving human capital building
and addressing structural issues in education needed for achieving equitable quality education. It has the potential to democratise knowledge access, making education more accessible and inclusive, particularly in resource-constrained countries. The growing use of educational technology (ed-tech) platforms has played a critical role in helping young people to complete their studies during the pandemic through remote learning, interactive material, and individualised learning experiences. Thanks to open educational resources (OERs), online courses, and digital libraries, learners can access educational materials at their own pace and convenience—which was extremely helpful during the pandemic.
Nevertheless, technology alone is insufficient
. The human element is crucial in delivering localised and contextualised education. While ed-tech platforms provide access to educational content, they should be complemented with effective pedagogical strategies and teacher support.

Navigating the Educational Seas: The Marvels and Challenges of Technology
The Rise of Digital Classrooms
Gone are the days of chalkboards and dusty erasers. The advent of technology has ushered in a new era of digital classrooms. Smartboards have replaced traditional blackboards, transforming lessons into interactive experiences. With a tap and a swipe, teachers can bring lessons to life, integrating multimedia elements to engage students in ways unimaginable a few decades ago.
Digital textbooks have also found their place on the educational stage. No more heavy backpacks laden with thick volumes; now, students can carry entire libraries in the palm of their hands. E-books provide convenience and accessibility, allowing learners to explore a vast array of subjects with just a few clicks.
Access to Information and Online Learning
The internet, a colossal repository of knowledge, has become the cornerstone of modern education. Students no longer need to rely solely on textbooks and encyclopedias; a world of information is just a search away. Online platforms offer a plethora of educational resources, from video tutorials to interactive simulations, enriching the learning experience.
The rise of online learning has democratized education, breaking down geographical barriers. Students from different corners of the globe can now connect with top-notch educators and institutions through virtual classrooms. This has opened up educational opportunities for those who might not have access to traditional brick-and-mortar schools.
Personalized Learning Paths
One of the remarkable impacts of technology on education is the ability to tailor learning experiences to individual needs. Adaptive learning software analyzes students' strengths and weaknesses, providing personalized lessons that cater to their unique learning styles. This not only enhances understanding but also fosters a more inclusive educational environment.
Educational apps and games further contribute to personalized learning. These interactive tools make education enjoyable, turning lessons into engaging activities. From mathematics to language acquisition, students can reinforce their skills while having fun, blurring the lines between study and play.
Challenges on the Horizon
Despite the wonders technology has brought to education, it also raises challenges that educators and policymakers must grapple with. The digital divide, the gap between those who have access to technology and those who don't, remains a significant issue. Inequitable distribution of resources may leave some students behind, widening existing disparities in educational outcomes.
Another concern is the potential for technology to replace human interaction. While digital communication has its merits, the importance of face-to-face interaction in the learning process should not be underestimated. Building social skills, empathy, and teamwork are crucial aspects of education that must not be overshadowed by the allure of screens.
Preparing Students for the Future
As we sail further into the digital age, it becomes increasingly important to equip students with the skills they need to navigate the complexities of the future. Technological literacy is no longer a luxury but a necessity. Schools must integrate coding, digital literacy, and critical thinking skills into their curricula to prepare students for a rapidly evolving job market.
Additionally, fostering creativity and adaptability is key. The jobs of tomorrow may not even exist today, and students need to be adept at learning new skills throughout their lives. Technology can play a role in cultivating these qualities, providing tools for creative expression and problem-solving.
Cultivating Lifelong Learning Habits
Technology has given rise to a culture of continuous learning, encouraging individuals to engage in lifelong education. Online platforms offer a plethora of courses, workshops, and tutorials catering to a wide range of interests and skill levels. This democratization of knowledge allows individuals to pursue learning opportunities beyond formal education, fostering a mindset of curiosity and self-improvement.
Moreover, technology has facilitated the creation of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), providing access to high-quality educational content from renowned institutions worldwide. This not only breaks down geographical barriers but also offers a cost-effective alternative for individuals seeking to acquire new skills or deepen their knowledge in specific areas.

Creativity and Innovation Skills
We know that the global marketplace is more competitive than ever. Innovative products and creative thoughts thrive on an organization's ability to design and present them in aesthetically pleasing ways. Creative thinking and application grab consumers' attention and secures their loyalty. Ultimately, creativity is a common language we can all learn to communicate our passions and ideas with. So, creativity and innovation are just valuable learning pursuits. It's a vital tool to success in school and in the workplace. For this reason, Creativity Fluency is used in thousands of schools all over the world.
The world is always appearing with a lot of changes in this digital age at exponential rates. By the time employees learn the newest software or program, a better version is coming about. Future employers will need to continuously adapt to changing conditions as well as be able to learn new things quickly and efficiently. We need our students to learn how to learn. We deal with trends of every kind constantly. Business, technology, entertainment, communication, and lifestyle trends are just some of the many.
What makes it more challenging is that each major trend can often have several sub-trends of its own. Keeping abreast of these means staying informed and knowing when to take advantage of opportunities. As for life itself, it will always have challenges, no matter how well things are going. Being able to adapt to change in all its forms keeps us constantly prepared to survive and succeed no matter what climate we're in.
In the present world, communication has transformed beyond face-to-face interaction. We communicate using technology more than ever.

"We often say that today's students are tomorrow's future. But we do not think about how today's students can become the bright future who may add a distinctive value for the upcoming generation. We also do not research on which education can make our children skilled and worthy citizens of the country. In the majority of schools and classrooms, it is observed that the students are mainly being assessed on lower-level thinking skills such as memorization and recall.
The multiple-choice, short-answer and matching questions, along with the academic assignments, are majorly dependent on the main modes of assessment or school prescribed methods which are running years after years. Many education commissions are formed to upgrade the education system of the country, but they cannot come out with the so-called systems of teaching and learning in classrooms.
Yes, some initiatives have been taken by some of the educationists of our country like creative questions, higher ability testing, communicative English learning, but it's the fact that the certain no standard modules are patterned which the teachers may follow or standardize their teaching in the classrooms.

Global Education: Empowering the Next Generation
In an increasingly interconnected world, global education has emerged as a crucial component of preparing students for the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century. It goes beyond traditional academic subjects, aiming to foster global citizenship, cultural understanding, and a sense of shared responsibility for our planet.
Global education equips students with the knowledge, skills, and attitudes necessary to navigate an interconnected world. It encourages them to think critically about global issues such as poverty, climate change, human rights, and social justice. By examining these complex challenges from multiple perspectives, students develop empathy and gain a deeper understanding of the world around them.
One key aspect of global education is promoting cultural competence. In our diverse societies, it is essential for students to appreciate and respect different cultures and traditions. By learning about other cultures’ histories, languages, religions, and customs, students develop a broader worldview that fosters tolerance and inclusivity.
Moreover, global education encourages interdisciplinary learning by integrating various subjects such as geography, history, economics, environmental science, and social studies. This multidisciplinary approach helps students connect the dots between different disciplines and understand how they intersect in addressing global challenges.
Technology plays a pivotal role in global education by breaking down geographical barriers. Through virtual exchanges and online collaborations with peers from different countries or cultures, students can engage in meaningful dialogue and learn from one another’s perspectives. These digital connections enable them to develop cross-cultural communication skills essential for success in today’s interconnected workforce.
Global education also emphasizes active engagement through service-learning projects or community involvement. By participating in local or international initiatives aimed at addressing social issues like poverty or inequality, students develop a sense of agency and realize their potential to make a positive impact on their communities – both locally and globally.
Furthermore, global education prepares students for an increasingly globalized job market. Employers are seeking individuals with intercultural competence who can collaborate effectively across borders and understand the complexities of global markets. By nurturing skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, adaptability, and cultural sensitivity, global education equips students with a competitive edge in today’s global workforce.
To ensure the success of global education, collaboration among educators, policymakers, and communities is crucial. Governments must prioritize the integration of global education into national curricula and provide professional development opportunities for teachers to enhance their knowledge and pedagogical strategies.
In conclusion, global education is a transformative approach that empowers the next generation to become active global citizens. By fostering cultural understanding, critical thinking, and a sense of shared responsibility, it equips students with the skills needed to navigate an interconnected world.

Building Safe Spaces: Ensuring Community Security
Creating safe spaces is essential for community well-being. By actively working towards community safety, we can ensure that everyone feels protected and supported. This section will explore various strategies and initiatives that can contribute to a safer environment.
Neighborhood Watch Programs
Neighborhood watch programs play a crucial role in preventing and deterring crime within communities. These programs involve residents collaborating with local law enforcement agencies to monitor and report suspicious activities. By keeping a watchful eye on their neighborhoods, participants contribute to a heightened sense of security and help establish a strong community bond. To start a neighborhood watch program in your area, reach out to your local police department or community organization for guidance and support.
Being prepared for emergencies is essential in safeguarding the community. Creating emergency plans and organizing training sessions can help community members respond effectively in crisis situations. This can include establishing communication channels, conducting drills, and educating residents about emergency procedures. By equipping individuals with the knowledge and skills necessary to handle emergencies, we can enhance the overall safety and resilience of our community.
Crime Prevention Initiatives
Preventing crime requires proactive efforts and community involvement. Collaborating with local law enforcement agencies and community organizations, residents can implement crime prevention initiatives. These initiatives may include organizing awareness campaigns, hosting educational workshops, and implementing security measures such as improved lighting and surveillance systems. By addressing the root causes of crime and fostering an environment that discourages criminal activities, we can create a safer community for everyone.","How can a community center revitalize its community art program to foster creativity and bring people together, considering the broader impact on community development and education?

This question requires expertise in the subtopic of strategies for supporting educational initiatives, as well as the given context of education and empowerment, community development, and community engagement."
"Education and Empowerment: Supporting Learning Opportunities
Education plays a critical role in empowering individuals and building strong communities. By supporting educational initiatives, we can create a nurturing environment that unlocks the full potential of community members. From providing resources to schools to promoting lifelong learning, there are various ways to support learning opportunities within our community.
One essential aspect of empowering community members is ensuring access to quality education. By advocating for educational resources and equitable opportunities for all, we can bridge the educational gap and empower individuals to thrive. Supporting schools through initiatives such as volunteering, mentorship programs, and donations can make a significant difference in shaping the future of our community.

Use of Text-Matching Software","How might the incorporation of Indigenous storytelling practices in educational settings impact the degree of cultural relevance and student engagement in the curriculum, and what are some potential challenges or limitations that educators may face in implementing such practices?"
"Okay, how do I follow that? Hello, my name is John Cope, and I'm Head of Education and Skills Policy at the CBI. The Confederation of British Industry represents about 190,000 businesses also. So my job is kind of one foot in business, listen to CEOs, managing directors of companies of all sizes, all sectors across the UK and internationally. But also we have a sort of a microcosm of the education system in membership as well says that 80 or 90 universities that are members of the CBI, including Nottingham Trent, with 40 or 50 colleges are members. We also have really strong links with school trusts, as well as the independent sector. So I kind of come at this from a from both angles and in those conversations. ones that I have for business leaders, it doesn't take very long until the topic of conversation goes to education skills, it does tend to be the number one priority for them. And it's that kind of mix of wanting a more productive, more vibrant economy. Combined with that kind of social good aspects of education, make sure everyone gets a good start in life. And I have a really strong belief actually, the employers have a huge role to play education skills, and a mentor or point officer role, the duty to do so to get involved with schools getting by with colleges and universities. And too often that role can be not quite as advanced as it could be. And I suppose the thing I would add about my work at the CBI education skills is that we come from the start point, but there is no reason why a young person shouldn't have a fantastic career. Every young person should have that career. There is no reason why you should have regional differences, why different young people from different backgrounds should start their career in a different way. So we come from that start point that talent is equally distributed, but opportunity is not. And and employers have a role in affecting that. And despite the million plus, or so students who they're good or outstanding school, and over the last 10 years or so, despite the very welcome, focus on rigor and knowledge in the curriculum, and also the sort of innovation in education that a lot of Multi Academy Trusts are pursuing, it still remains the case that there is a significant disadvantage gap means young people at the age of 16 can be nearly two years behind the more advantaged peers. And from a CBI perspective, not only is that morally questionable, and we allow that situation to happen, but actually that disadvantage gap is lost business leaders, it's lost scientists, it's lost innovators, lost leaders of the future. And we have a duty to address it.
Thank you very much. And I'm going to start the questioning off with a little reflection really of my own IT digital background in that when I started teaching, and we didn't have computers, and and we certainly didn't have the digital natives that we now have in our classrooms. And I've got two daughters, who, you know, the the technology is as comfortable with them as a book, you know, as it was with when I was growing up. So, in terms of the future, what skills are young people our digital natives going to need for the future? And how can schools provide them when they're staffed by a lot of people who weren't digital natives? Maybe Nancy first?
Yeah, very happy to take this one first. And I actually think so. So I think it's a really interesting question, and I actually feel like there's some of the skills that are most needed in the kind of work. I was on a panel yesterday talking about the fourth industrial revolution. So I don't really like that term that much. But considering technology is changing all of our lives and automation is going to change lots of the jobs that young people are going to go into in the future. I actually kind of think, alongside the digital skills that you've mentioned, it's the skills or kind of more human skills that we really need to foster in young people. Things like collaboration and problem solving, we know is really important teamwork, as well as the social and social and emotional skills and resilience that are going to be so important in our in our changing world as we as we all know it. Nesta produce some research a couple of years ago on the future of work and found that the skills I've just mentioned, those are most likely to grow in the future world of work and be important. So I think although we do completely appreciate that the role of technology and people need to have access to that, but actually, it's alongside those human skills that will make the real difference to people and how they thrive in the future.

But also we have a sort of a microcosm of the education system in membership as well says that 80 or 90 universities that are members of the CBI, including Nottingham Trent, with 40 or 50 colleges are members. We also have really strong links with school trusts, as well as the independent sector. So I kind of come at this from a from both angles and in those conversations. ones that I have for business leaders, it doesn't take very long until the topic of conversation goes to education skills, it does tend to be the number one priority for them. And it's that kind of mix of wanting a more productive, more vibrant economy. Combined with that kind of social good aspects of education, make sure everyone gets a good start in life. And I have a really strong belief actually, the employers have a huge role to play education skills, and a mentor or point officer role, the duty to do so to get involved with schools getting by with colleges and universities. And too often that role can be not quite as advanced as it could be. And I suppose the thing I would add about my work at the CBI education skills is that we come from the start point, but there is no reason why a young person shouldn't have a fantastic career. Every young person should have that career. There is no reason why you should have regional differences, why different young people from different backgrounds should start their career in a different way. So we come from that start point that talent is equally distributed, but opportunity is not. And and employers have a role in affecting that. And despite the million plus, or so students who they're good or outstanding school, and over the last 10 years or so, despite the very welcome, focus on rigor and knowledge in the curriculum, and also the sort of innovation in education that a lot of Multi Academy Trusts are pursuing, it still remains the case that there is a significant disadvantage gap means young people at the age of 16 can be nearly two years behind the more advantaged peers. And from a CBI perspective, not only is that morally questionable, and we allow that situation to happen, but actually that disadvantage gap is lost business leaders, it's lost scientists, it's lost innovators, lost leaders of the future. And we have a duty to address it.
Thank you very much. And I'm going to start the questioning off with a little reflection really of my own IT digital background in that when I started teaching, and we didn't have computers, and and we certainly didn't have the digital natives that we now have in our classrooms. And I've got two daughters, who, you know, the the technology is as comfortable with them as a book, you know, as it was with when I was growing up. So, in terms of the future, what skills are young people our digital natives going to need for the future? And how can schools provide them when they're staffed by a lot of people who weren't digital natives? Maybe Nancy first?
Yeah, very happy to take this one first. And I actually think so. So I think it's a really interesting question, and I actually feel like there's some of the skills that are most needed in the kind of work. I was on a panel yesterday talking about the fourth industrial revolution. So I don't really like that term that much. But considering technology is changing all of our lives and automation is going to change lots of the jobs that young people are going to go into in the future. I actually kind of think, alongside the digital skills that you've mentioned, it's the skills or kind of more human skills that we really need to foster in young people. Things like collaboration and problem solving, we know is really important teamwork, as well as the social and social and emotional skills and resilience that are going to be so important in our in our changing world as we as we all know it. Nesta produce some research a couple of years ago on the future of work and found that the skills I've just mentioned, those are most likely to grow in the future world of work and be important. So I think although we do completely appreciate that the role of technology and people need to have access to that, but actually, it's alongside those human skills that will make the real difference to people and how they thrive in the future.

"School communities have experienced a radical change in the way education is delivered in the past few years. While these changes, such as remote, online and blended learning have undoubtedly expanded the reach of educational resources and experiences, there are still challenges ahead. It is imperative that in promoting new methods for delivering education at all levels we do not forget to lay strong foundations.
In order to make use of innovative tools, teachers, students and administrators alike need to be supported over a while. This entails training, financial resources and activities tailored to strengthen learning communities. New technologies should be welcomed but not at the expense of those that use them. Users of digital platforms should have clear information about the use of their data and governments should protect their citizens from seemingly free software that capitalizes on user’s data. Education should remain accessible, and become more accessible where it is not already.
Just like the Twin Transition has become central in achieving both the Digital and the Green transition, schools should be supported in multiple ways. If we can recognise their crucial role in every society, we must reconcile with the fact that it is complex and needs the right roles in order to keep functioning, leaving no one behind.
Students are not in school for one specific objective and schools should not be operating like factories or enterprises. Students and learners must remain central and safeguarded. If we want future generations to be better equipped we should look into the knowledge and needs of those that are here now. This means more representation of all the groups that make up a school. Their needs and insight are crucial to tackling issues, from the implementation of new technologies to the fight against social inequality.

"Yeah, they are. I would add, I suppose that is to reinforce just how critical this is, you know, we often do surveys of our members. And whenever we ask them about where their vacancies are, where their skills gaps, we have a very consistent number that about two thirds of our members will come back and say, actually, they have digital vacancies. So they have jobs there in digital, they cannot fill. And digital is the area where they know they're going to have great skill gaps over the coming years and will invest the most. So for solutions, which I guess is at the heart of this question, I think the first thing is to try and get away from thinking of digital as a subject. And, you know, we used to have ICT lessons and things like that, and I know I did, I had a one hour or month or something like that there was on ICT. I never quite know what the value of that that was. So I think he's getting away from it as a subject and actually viewing it much more along the same lines as numeracy literacy. Actually, digital needs to be weaved into every single subject. And it needs to be core to everything. And so I suppose it's that first year getting getting away from as a subject and thinking of it much more as a competency is something that that should be embedded. The second point I'd make, I suppose, is about the breadth of the curriculum. And this is quite sort of quite a wide point I suppose to make just about, I'd say obviously what is the point of GCSE is now given that most young people are all young people stay in educational change at what is the purpose of GCSEs at 16. So, you know, our members of regularly will sort of say to us that they feel that young people are getting a more and more and more narrow curriculum, and how can that be broadened? So one of the questions that were asking at the CBI do regularly ask of government is, is now the right time to start that conversation about rethinking GCSEs entirely about was the point exams, huge amount of pressure and capacity put into 16, but actually mostly stay in to 18 and that that creates the opportunity to have a lot more creativity subjects which have declined over the last 10 years. It also broadens out to help this show be embedded in more and on to the next stage who some amazing analysis done by the Royal Society, about A-Levels over how disadvantaged young people, on average to 2.4 A-Levels to 2.4 subjects. So the idea that a young person by the age of 18 can narrow themselves down to less than three subjects at the age of 18. feels wrong to me. And I think the the changing world of work, globalisation, ai automation requires greater breadth than ever. And yet we're going the opposite direction and actually narrowing down and I I would add on then on to the next stage on to higher education and technical, first and higher education. And I think culturally, and regulatory and pretty much every part of the system and the financial system drives universities to very traditional approaches to higher education.

When you leave the fate of Quality Education up to the Ignorant and uneducated, they will fail to see the value and integrated importance of Quality Education, and they will fail to provide it for future generations. Intellects, Self-Educators, and Life-Long Learners will reach a point very soon where the Self-Educated will “fire” and Abolish the Self-Deemed “Authorities” in Education for being so grossly inadequate in their own Education, which has lead to their own inability to see, very clearly, the value and need for Quality Education that they so naively can’t see.
And how many teachers are incapable of even answering the one question every student asked? “Why do I have to study this subject?” Not one teacher has ever given the correct answer that I have ever heard. Do you remember asking that question to your teacher when you were in school? How many of them could answer? In my school, not one could answer. Not. One.
Answer : The reason why you have to study math, logic, history, physics, and the sciences is so that you can perceive a multi-faceted Perspective that will allow you to understand your Point of Origin and a wider range of comprehension so you can make educated decisions that take into account catalyst, chain reaction, and consequence to your choices, leading you to a happier life.
The reason why we must study art, music, dance, and theater is to nurture our ability to imagine, which is the fountainhead required for problems solving, authority, autonomy, independent thinking, and thinking “outside of the box.” It is the core of Perspective Shifting so you can view a single topic, problem, or situation from multiple angles.
Math, Physics, and the Sciences help you manage your Logical Health and sharpen your Intuitive Logic so you can better navigate yourself through life resulting in little to no Mental Illness. Leading to Effective Communication so you can transfer and receive information, and so you can make healthy connections and nourish those connections resulting in a strong network and circuit of likeminded individuals.
That is why you have to study these subjects. To gain Perspective, effective communications skills, and the ability to maneuver through and around problems as they arise.
You were taught by a teacher who was so uneducated in their own subject of mastery that they didn’t even know it’s purpose. How much do you trust your own education? How much do you trust your previous educators?
The majority of 3rd and 4th Perspectives don’t want education because they know, intuitively, that this will cause a divide. They know proper education will cause a Schism between Higher Education vs. Lower Education because they logically know, deep down in their gut, that they’ll be “stuck” in the Lower Education bracket. Where they think they will be condemned to doing all the grunt work without the benefit of being in charge… or so they think. They internalize their own actions onto others with the belief that “If someone is smarter than me, then they will make me their slave,” because that is what they would do.
Education is Power. And that is what this is really about. Monopolizing the Power so that those in charge stay in charge. And those without Power stay ignorant and obedient (submissive).

· Children’s home life, especially in light of any issues they may have at school.
· Any assistance you have been capable of providing your child.
· Your thoughts on your child’s development and the kind of assistance that could require.","How can educators balance the need to provide clear instructions and expectations with the need to encourage autonomy and self-directed learning in a technology-integrated classroom, while also taking into account the unique developmental needs and abilities of each student?"

"And I suppose I would make two points, one about news get a sense of urgency, on fourth industrial revolution, and it's far more complex than we think. And then I'll say a little bit about some of these the four C's, these competencies, skills, frameworks, whatever you want to call them. And so I suppose on the on the first point about the fourth industrial revolution, we need to stop pretending that it's an upcoming event. We're in the fourth Indus revolution is happening, and we keep talking about it like it's sort of about to happen, you know, a lot of the a lot of the impacts of the fourth interest revolution of AI automation and things like that have been happening for a good decade or so. So there is a sense of urgency that we still need to get on this. And that impact of AI and automation is incredibly complex. So everyone's experience of it will be very different. In each sector of the economy, each level, each seniority in a business will be affected very differently. And the one thing that the fourth interest revolution, and kind of is different to previous revolutions that the agrarian and the industrial revolution is their effect all levels of society, the previous industry revolutions tended to impact the low skill and low pay jobs, whereas the fourth revolution is quite as likely to have an impact on what we currently consider to be very high skill, very high paid jobs. So you think about finance, very easy to automate, very easy to use AI and huge swathes of the financial sector. So you know, we can look at the kind of sectors that currently we because it'll be very high paid, very high skilled, actually, they're as vulnerable as drivers. For instance, obviously, the automation of cars would affect. So there's a sense of urgency, the fourth industrial revolution, there's a need to have a nuanced view that will impact all of us in in different ways. And it also needs to be set alongside other challenges that we have. You think about life expectancy as your most favorite statistics that in the last century, for every four hours that past, life expectancy increased by an hour is absolutely astonishing that and that for the entire the last century, that was happening, what that means is that people like me will be working well into their 80s. And if will retire at all. And so the idea that actually we front load education, the idea that we can pour as much education as possible by the age of 18, and 21. If that ever was possible, that idea is certainly dead by now. And then the need to go into lifelong learning is incredibly important. And the second point I was going to make around the sort of frameworks and skills and you have a five pound for every skills framework, I was asked to look at and say just this, will this make the young person work ready, I'd be a very wealthy person. And we did a bit of a literature review of all these frameworks. And you can find about 200 of them. They all use different language, different interpretations, different perspectives on the same thing. And if I'm honest, one of the big problems we have is there are so many of these frameworks, it's deeply confusing for both employers, teachers and young people to actually understand what are the skills that we need? So in order to try and cut through that a little bit, we're at CBI, we set out as a kind of an attempt to answer the question, what does it mean for a young person to work ready? It comes down to three quite simple things. First and foremost is knowledge. There's no escaping that actually knowledge rich curriculum is absolutely vital.

"And I suppose I would make two points, one about news get a sense of urgency, on fourth industrial revolution, and it's far more complex than we think. And then I'll say a little bit about some of these the four C's, these competencies, skills, frameworks, whatever you want to call them. And so I suppose on the on the first point about the fourth industrial revolution, we need to stop pretending that it's an upcoming event. We're in the fourth Indus revolution is happening, and we keep talking about it like it's sort of about to happen, you know, a lot of the a lot of the impacts of the fourth interest revolution of AI automation and things like that have been happening for a good decade or so. So there is a sense of urgency that we still need to get on this. And that impact of AI and automation is incredibly complex. So everyone's experience of it will be very different. In each sector of the economy, each level, each seniority in a business will be affected very differently. And the one thing that the fourth interest revolution, and kind of is different to previous revolutions that the agrarian and the industrial revolution is their effect all levels of society, the previous industry revolutions tended to impact the low skill and low pay jobs, whereas the fourth revolution is quite as likely to have an impact on what we currently consider to be very high skill, very high paid jobs. So you think about finance, very easy to automate, very easy to use AI and huge swathes of the financial sector. So you know, we can look at the kind of sectors that currently we because it'll be very high paid, very high skilled, actually, they're as vulnerable as drivers. For instance, obviously, the automation of cars would affect. So there's a sense of urgency, the fourth industrial revolution, there's a need to have a nuanced view that will impact all of us in in different ways. And it also needs to be set alongside other challenges that we have. You think about life expectancy as your most favorite statistics that in the last century, for every four hours that past, life expectancy increased by an hour is absolutely astonishing that and that for the entire the last century, that was happening, what that means is that people like me will be working well into their 80s. And if will retire at all. And so the idea that actually we front load education, the idea that we can pour as much education as possible by the age of 18, and 21. If that ever was possible, that idea is certainly dead by now. And then the need to go into lifelong learning is incredibly important. And the second point I was going to make around the sort of frameworks and skills and you have a five pound for every skills framework, I was asked to look at and say just this, will this make the young person work ready, I'd be a very wealthy person. And we did a bit of a literature review of all these frameworks. And you can find about 200 of them. They all use different language, different interpretations, different perspectives on the same thing. And if I'm honest, one of the big problems we have is there are so many of these frameworks, it's deeply confusing for both employers, teachers and young people to actually understand what are the skills that we need? So in order to try and cut through that a little bit, we're at CBI, we set out as a kind of an attempt to answer the question, what does it mean for a young person to work ready? It comes down to three quite simple things. First and foremost is knowledge. There's no escaping that actually knowledge rich curriculum is absolutely vital. All, you know, the too often we slip into Oh, but we've got Google, or you've got all the knowledge the human knows in the phone. Well actually, if you don't know how to start point, you don't know what you're looking for. So actually, we should never forget the importance of knowledge. The second part of what it means to work ready is actually to apply that knowledge in a real world setting. You know, there's no point in knowing how many wives Henry the Eighth had unless, you know, the impact, the reason the the significance of that. And then third is sort of the points that we've just heard is character. And this is probably the most difficult thing to really pin down what character really means. But it is a mixture of creativity, of team playing, of being able to deal with knocks that life sends. And I go back to how I sort of introduced you know, I think it's also very important not to actually expect the education system to deliver all of that. The education system is not able and we should not ask it to make every young person work ready to deliver all parts of that. There's a real important role actually, in employers stepping up on those two areas of character and applying knowledge in real world settings, actually, for employers to step up giving people at work experience, give them careers talks, bring them into the real world, and show them how their knowledge",What are the implications of a recent study suggesting that millennial workers are more likely to change jobs due to lack of personal fulfillment rather than financial reasons?
"We are working at a moment in history when education is changing. For more than one generation into the 21st century, adults have been trying to figure out how to create schools that reflect the changing society and culture. For those generations, adults have spoken of the need to create “21st century schools.” (I have a former colleague who would recoil every time she heard that phrase. “It’s too late,” she would say, “its going be over before we stop talking about building schools for it.”) These adults have been grounding all of their recommendations in old and outdated assumptions about teaching and learning and technology. Compounding the problems that arise from this is the rate at which everything changes—what we teach, how we teach, and the tools we have for teaching change far more rapidly than they did for previous generations.
What has become clear to me in the time since I began my career in the field, is the schools we need now, and that we will continue to need long after I have retired are will be places where great expertise comes together to create a place that cannot be created by any one individual. Our future schools depend on:
- Information technology that is always functioning and available to all students and teachers.
- Teaching and learning that is diverse and responsive to the needs to teachers and learners and that prepares all for the unpredictable future.
- Decisions made that ensure these schools exist and that all families can send their children to one of these schools.","How can schools balance the need for personalized learning with concerns about the potential bias in AI-powered adaptive testing software, while ensuring that all students have equitable access to relevant educational resources?

"The only way this can be done effectively is with good communication. Having communication skills means less stress, more productivity, and better relationships. Future employers need to be able to communicate with people within their team, as well as people outside of the team and organization.
Working in groups is a hallmark of the digital age. Our classrooms and businesses incorporate teamwork into their daily practices and also foster a culture of competition and independence rather than one of teamwork and collaboration. As such, collaborative abilities have a permanent place among the most beneficial lifelong learning skills all students should develop. Future employers will need to quickly adapt to a culture of collaboration. They will need to collaborate with others within and outside of the organization, often using a number of new technologies.
This means being able to work in groups that are both physical and virtual. It includes proficiency in communication, empathy, and leadership values. It also means being able to work with someone across the world as easily and productively as someone across the room. This is why Collaboration skill is one of the Essential Skills being taught in classrooms all over the world.
Leaders are an asset in any classroom and in every workforce. Anyone whose attitude moves from “I can do it” to “we can do it” makes everybody better. It's their independence and willingness to take responsibility for making good things happen, not just simply getting things done. That's why leaders see more, do more, and learn more.
Understanding leadership is one of those beneficial lifelong learning skills that can change people's lives. After all, one who leads isn't just one who manages things. What a leader does is inspire, motivate, and empower. True leaders see the best in people and teach them to harness their potential in all they do.
Problem Solving Skills
The world is changing and will continue changing dramatically. As such our children will be solving future problems that we can't even imagine yet. They'll face challenges that require skills to define a problem, design an appropriate solution, and put it to effective use.
Problem-solving skills help them tackle anything from writing a shopping list to designing and realizing their biggest dreams. As far as beneficial lifelong learning skills go, this one is probably the most important. Solving real-world problems with a process like Solution Fluency is crucial to surviving and thriving in the present and future.
Critical Thinking Skills
The way we think about the world, ourselves and each other affects more than just personal experience. It has a part in defining the future of everything and everyone and the entire world—this is the “Ripple Effect.” It's been a part of many cultural philosophies for thousands of years, reminding us that how we choose to think and act influences our whole world. We don't have to be overwhelmed by it, just simply aware of it as it guides our critical thinking practices.
There is a decreased emphasis on employers following directions and an increased emphasis on employers thinking critically and solving problems. In a rapidly changing world, employers need employees who can solve problems, provide ideas and help improve the organization. The ability to think critically is a must for future success in a changing world. It's about thinking independently, responsibly, and productively. In fact, one of the best definitions of critical thinking can be found on the Critical Thinking Web. The latest term is used in thinking skills as ‘Internet of Thinking' (IoT).
Information Management Skills
Dealing with information means we can determine what is valuable and discard what is spurious or questionable. This is important for producing solutions and products that are genuine and useful. It's also an aspect of research and proper attribution of sources, things every good digital citizen needs to know. Information is essentially all things on the Internet, and it's alive and growing.
Personal Management Skills
Personal management is one of the basic skills to overcome future challenges. This includes the ability for employers to independently plan, organize, create and execute, rather than wait for someone to do this for them.
Curiosity and Inquiry Skills
Without curiosity and inquiry skills there is no learning effectively. Lifelong learning is driven by curiosity. Outside the rigours of school, there is no educator or peer to motivate us to learn and expand our minds. Developing curiosity is undoubtedly one of the most beneficial lifelong learning skills you can have. Nurturing curiosity can lead to moments where a learner says, “wow, I never expected that in school.”","How can a manager effectively balance the need for clear direction with the need for autonomy and flexibility in a team working on a high-stakes project, while also considering the diverse communication styles of team members from different cultural backgrounds?"

Online platforms encourage interactions
We begin with a feature that benefits and augments traditional learning practices in particular. Namely, online platforms enhance classroom-based studying and take it outside schools and colleges by encouraging social interactions between students and teachers.
For example, a professor can quickly create a Facebook group and invite his/her students to join the community. They can use the group to share ideas, upload documents, discuss classroom topics, exchange learning materials, and many more.
This is also the way to promote interactions among peers and help them break social barriers through online conversations.
Education becomes globally accessible
Unlike traditional learning, online education is globally accessible. How come? The idea is simple – all it takes is a stable Internet connection to gain access to various learning resources. A report reveals that almost four billion people use the Internet on a global scale.
In other words, more than half of the world’s population is able to find and use online studying tools at any given moment. This makes eLearning an unprecedented phenomenon that drastically changes the entire education market. Such a high level of accessibility can help people all over the world to begin studying and increasing the odds of making a career breakthrough.
Besides that, online learning is not time-bound as there are no plans, schedules, and calendars. It means that students can learn their lessons whenever they choose to.
A growing number of learning resources
The Internet is literally endless, so the only logical conclusion is that it can gradually build an all-encompassing library of learning resources. Of course, it will take years or even decades to systemize and categorize online studying resources, but it’s clear that the concept itself is incredibly powerful.
You don’t have to go beyond Wikipedia to understand the effect of online platforms on education. Although not perfect, Wikipedia already gives comprehensive and accurate answers to many questions and makes the studying process faster and simpler. There are also millions of other resources, including digital courses, eBooks, webinars, etc.
Free learning resources
This feature goes hand in hand with the previous one. Namely, the Internet is packed with learning resources that are not only valuable but also free of charge. We already mentioned Wikipedia as one example, but there many other platforms to check out. Some of the best free resources are:
- Project Gutenberg: If you are interested in free eBooks, this platform will give you over 60 thousand options.
- YouTube EDU: Video learning fans can find amazing materials on YouTube EDU.
- Udemy: You can find a plethora of free courses on Udemy.
Online learning assistance programs
The days when students had to do all the work on their own are long gone. Today, the Internet is offering you dozens of high-quality learning assistance programs. Using their services, you can plan and write school or college papers in a matter of hours.
The only problem is how to choose the best platforms from a wide range of more or less similar services, but we can give you a hand by pointing out proven solutions in the field. In our experience, the best content creation platforms are essay writing service, uk-dissertation.com, and essay writing help.

- It is a process of becoming aware of oneself and, as a result, of one’s entire existence.
- It is the process of recognizing and fulfilling one’s relationship with every unit in existence.

- We recognize: Today, we all recognize things, and we recognize a wide range of things. We recognize water, our parents, our friends, and so on. This is referred to as recognizing.

The next time you are teaching a lesson, count how many questions students are asked.
When students are herded and corralled into the narrow chute of standardized testing, they are so heavily indoctrinated with fear of failure that only a fool would dare venture off the beaten path. We are, after all, talking about young people, and can hardly expect them to rebel against it (considering this may make you rethink those students who actually do). The consequences of straying are so fierce: the promise of no job; the shame of failure; the ire of the school. It is no wonder then that students are afraid to take risks and think for themselves, and why inevitably so many unnecessary questions are asked.
To add insult to injury, when governments decide in their wisdom that the solution to ensuring progress in education is to standardize testing even more, they force schools to constrict curricula further. They reduce the opportunities to explore creativity in subjects. They trim a course down to its quantitative shell, and by doing so reduce a student’s opportunities to develop problem-solving strategies. Essentially, they force schools to produce hydroponic students.
Teaching Students In Authentic Contexts
Whilst using hydroponics to grow fruit and vegetables seems like the golden ticket to solving the world’s food problems, the method, while yielding ostensibly larger and faster produce, is significantly flawed in three ways: first, the final product lacks real nutrient and substance, and ultimately taste.
Secondly, the plant itself grows in a very unnatural and toxic state, absorbing inordinate quantities of chemicals and pesticides to control it at every turn, which must affect its overall enjoyment in growing, and thirdly, once the plant is gone and the process is over, it leaves no positive legacy – in fact, it depletes the ground around it. When students are taught in unnatural conditions, with the sole purpose of producing quantifiable results, they too suffer in three similar ways:
First, when they finish their education with a whole lot of credentials, (if they have managed to get through the system), they may lack any real depth of knowledge and any ability to problem solve. This is because the learning has been too shallow, only concentrating on aspects of a course that need to be learned for standardized testing. Like the roots of the hydroponic plant, the brain’s synapses aren’t encouraged to expand and strengthen because there isn’t any opportunity or need to do so. The more prescriptive the learning, the less chance the student has to wander off the path, and get dirty, and find solutions to get out of the mud. Necessity is the mother of invention, but when students aren’t ever given such chances, they lose the capacity to think on their feet, and eventually, to think for themselves in most situations.
Secondly, if students are encased day after day in the confines of the school building, seated for extraordinary long periods of time in rows of desks, and ushered from class to lunch to class under the strict timings of bells, the process of distancing the young from their natural condition is well underway. If students are doused with pointless and irrelevant information disguised as learning, it is obvious that they won’t enjoy school.
Even well-meaning teachers can fall foul to the system, themselves operating in fear of not covering the required territory. In fact, it’s an impossible feat to teach the amount of stipulated material of most subjects to any level of depth to the average class. To curb the natural inclination of students to disengage in such a learning context, schools superficially inoculate their students with countless tirades, warning against disengagement and punishing culprits in attempts to quell it. It is no wonder that students can feel that their paths in learning and growth have become stifled and one-directional and oppressed. It is no wonder they rarely if ever connect learning with happiness.
Thirdly, because of the shallowness of the learning required for standardized tests, and the lack of base in the knowledge creation, the transference of the learning into new contexts is limited. The process yields little reward after the examination period, and does little to sustain the learner, or indeed the community around him or her. The student raised in the hothouse of standardized testing struggles to think outside the box, to solve new problems and ultimately flourish and contribute to a rapidly changing 21st century world.","What are some potential strategies to promote student engagement in a science project that focuses on sustainable urban planning, and how can these strategies be adapted to accommodate students with diverse learning needs?"

It is no wonder they rarely if ever connect learning with happiness.
Thirdly, because of the shallowness of the learning required for standardized tests, and the lack of base in the knowledge creation, the transference of the learning into new contexts is limited. The process yields little reward after the examination period, and does little to sustain the learner, or indeed the community around him or her.

The next time you are teaching a lesson, count how many questions students are asked.
When students are herded and corralled into the narrow chute of standardized testing, they are so heavily indoctrinated with fear of failure that only a fool would dare venture off the beaten path. We are, after all, talking about young people, and can hardly expect them to rebel against it (considering this may make you rethink those students who actually do). The consequences of straying are so fierce: the promise of no job; the shame of failure; the ire of the school. It is no wonder then that students are afraid to take risks and think for themselves, and why inevitably so many unnecessary questions are asked.
To add insult to injury, when governments decide in their wisdom that the solution to ensuring progress in education is to standardize testing even more, they force schools to constrict curricula further. They reduce the opportunities to explore creativity in subjects. They trim a course down to its quantitative shell, and by doing so reduce a student’s opportunities to develop problem-solving strategies. Essentially, they force schools to produce hydroponic students.
Teaching Students In Authentic Contexts
Whilst using hydroponics to grow fruit and vegetables seems like the golden ticket to solving the world’s food problems, the method, while yielding ostensibly larger and faster produce, is significantly flawed in three ways: first, the final product lacks real nutrient and substance, and ultimately taste.
Secondly, the plant itself grows in a very unnatural and toxic state, absorbing inordinate quantities of chemicals and pesticides to control it at every turn, which must affect its overall enjoyment in growing, and thirdly, once the plant is gone and the process is over, it leaves no positive legacy – in fact, it depletes the ground around it. When students are taught in unnatural conditions, with the sole purpose of producing quantifiable results, they too suffer in three similar ways:
First, when they finish their education with a whole lot of credentials, (if they have managed to get through the system), they may lack any real depth of knowledge and any ability to problem solve. This is because the learning has been too shallow, only concentrating on aspects of a course that need to be learned for standardized testing. Like the roots of the hydroponic plant, the brain’s synapses aren’t encouraged to expand and strengthen because there isn’t any opportunity or need to do so. The more prescriptive the learning, the less chance the student has to wander off the path, and get dirty, and find solutions to get out of the mud. Necessity is the mother of invention, but when students aren’t ever given such chances, they lose the capacity to think on their feet, and eventually, to think for themselves in most situations.
Secondly, if students are encased day after day in the confines of the school building, seated for extraordinary long periods of time in rows of desks, and ushered from class to lunch to class under the strict timings of bells, the process of distancing the young from their natural condition is well underway.

So just picking up on what Nancy said we have been actually used virtual reality perhaps people pick up on like it's a new thing. But I've been working in virtual reality for over 20 years and special schools, which students with autism, there's a really strong evidence base, but Nancy might be right that's in the academic community. So we know that virtual environments have been used to teach independent living skills to students with learning disabilities, employment skills, but it can also augment cognitive skills, such as working memory, choice, reaction time, independent decision making. That's all in the academic literature. So now that we have the second, it's actually the third or fourth wave of virtual reality. So we have headsets like the Oculus quest, for 400 pounds wireless, you can have incredible virtual experiences. But there's also the evidence base of perhaps our challenge in academia, is join with government organisations and join with Nesta as well to actually get that information that evidence base as teachers in terms of what works in terms of game making virtual environments. And in terms of robotics as well, where we've all had positive European projects, which show those technologies can teach skills, but they can also engaging people and encourage collaboration and better behavior. So I think perhaps the challenge is universities to work with government and non government organisations now to get that information to teachers, because there's a lot of evidence already existing about what works and what doesn't work. So we need to augment the evidence base and build it as well.
And to go to James's question, and this just pops up I have a I could associate it with quite a lot I'm of the generation and where the interactive whiteboard was rolled out in every classroom across the country, before very swiftly Blackboard in front of it, because the teacher had no idea how to use it. And if they did, add very little value to the classroom anyway, at least that was my, my experience. So I would I would I would repeat everything that's been said about the need, actually for schools and colleges universities to be supported. I would I would pose the question of who is curating the knowledge, who is curating the pedagogy and all the different things that are going on in the system. You know, you look at other professions, like, you know, in medicine, you have the BMA, they'll curate that. So I think there is a role here for the College of teaching, to actually step up and start playing that role and curating the knowledge crazy understanding. And I would point to one of the most fascinating examples of this in Japan, but their entire co equivalent of Ofsted and their framework actually has it built into it collaboration to teachers and schools are actually rewarded for sharing lesson plans for sharing what works and things like that. So I would pose the question of, you know, why do we have a body this kind of purpose is to curate, the knowledge and the system and to sort of spread breath practice. Why don't we have like the rest of the economy out of the country, we have a 2.4% R&D investment target as a country? Why do we not have a 2.4% equivalent target actually in pedagogy in education, where we are investing in research as a country, about these new methods.
That's a fantastic note on which to end this panel. And I genuinely think that maybe the education endowment foundation might be the organisation that could pick that up and curate that.

This panel discussion was recorded live on 14th November 2019, in the Main Stage of the Schools & Academies Show at the NEC in Birmingham.
Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome to our next session, our panel session on technology and the role of technology in improving social mobility. So we've had to just begin by asking everybody to introduce themselves and just say a little bit about who they are, where they're from.
So I'm Nancy Wilkinson, and I work at an organisation called Nesta. So Nesta is an innovation foundation, which basically means we try and work on different problems particularly to do with social good and we find new ways of doing tackling those. And education is a real focus for us in our organisation. And I'll tell you in a second, a little bit about some of our work that we're doing on edtech. But a bit about my background. So I have worked in education policy for the last eight years, and I'm now leading our work at Nesta on education technology. I'm also a school governor in a small Primary School in Tower Hamlets in London. So I see as well as some of the day to day challenges of working with schools, particularly from disadvantaged communities. So just very briefly on Nesta's work in edtech. So we working in partnership with the Department for Education, to help schools and colleges make more effective use of technology. We think it has some real potential to do some great things in our education sector, but it often doesn't live up to expectations, it can often be difficult to use. It's difficult for schools to know what to choose that's right for them. So we have two programs that we're working on. One is a grant funding program, which we announced yesterday, some of the winners of that grant funding, which are all digital tools that we think can be really helpful for schools and teachers, particularly in tackling teacher workload. And the second half of our program is our edtech innovation testbed. So that's an opportunity for schools and colleges to take part in trying out technology for free with working with an external evaluator to really get to grips on what's working so we can get some better evidence for what's out there. So this is my tiny plug. Applications for schools and colleges are open now. So if anyone has any questions about that specifically, you can find me afterwards but yeah, really excited for the discussion. Thank you.

One is to use machine learning and artificial intelligence to create personalised learning systems for students with autism and learning disabilities. But also for students in higher education, you might be surprised to find that students in higher education aren't always engaged in the learning process. So I've developed projects on educational robotics on serious games, and more recently on digital game based making as well, not just using games, but making games as well. More recently, we have another ESRC funded project. And I'm looking at the well being of young students in education. So again, we use sensor data that might be we're co creating objects, which are networked that children use in schools and the sensor data that can interpret their level of anxiety and we can then introduce non medicalised approaches to intervene.

What impact does EdTech have on social mobility? How can we best prepare young people for future opportunities and ensure lifelong learning? What impact does the Government’s National Retraining Scheme have on teaching and learning? This conversation is chaired by Andy Mellor (National Immediate Past President, NAHT), with panellists Nancy Wilkinson (Senior Programme Manager, Nesta), Professor David Brown (Professor of Interactive Systems for Social Inclusion, Nottingham Trent University) and John Cope (Head of Education & Skills Policy, Confederation of British Industry). This panel discussion was recorded live on 14th November 2019, in the Main Stage of the Schools & Academies Show at the NEC in Birmingham.
Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome to our next session, our panel session on technology and the role of technology in improving social mobility. So we've had to just begin by asking everybody to introduce themselves and just say a little bit about who they are, where they're from.
So I'm Nancy Wilkinson, and I work at an organisation called Nesta. So Nesta is an innovation foundation, which basically means we try and work on different problems particularly to do with social good and we find new ways of doing tackling those. And education is a real focus for us in our organisation. And I'll tell you in a second, a little bit about some of our work that we're doing on edtech. But a bit about my background. So I have worked in education policy for the last eight years, and I'm now leading our work at Nesta on education technology. I'm also a school governor in a small Primary School in Tower Hamlets in London. So I see as well as some of the day to day challenges of working with schools, particularly from disadvantaged communities. So just very briefly on Nesta's work in edtech. So we working in partnership with the Department for Education, to help schools and colleges make more effective use of technology. We think it has some real potential to do some great things in our education sector, but it often doesn't live up to expectations, it can often be difficult to use. It's difficult for schools to know what to choose that's right for them. So we have two programs that we're working on. One is a grant funding program, which we announced yesterday, some of the winners of that grant funding, which are all digital tools that we think can be really helpful for schools and teachers, particularly in tackling teacher workload. And the second half of our program is our edtech innovation testbed. So that's an opportunity for schools and colleges to take part in trying out technology for free with working with an external evaluator to really get to grips on what's working so we can get some better evidence for what's out there. So this is my tiny plug. Applications for schools and colleges are open now. So if anyone has any questions about that specifically, you can find me afterwards but yeah, really excited for the discussion. Thank you.
Professor David Brown
So good afternoon. My name is David Brown. I'm Professor of interactive systems for social inclusion at Nottingham Trent University. I'm principal investigator for three European and I said European grants. One is to use machine learning and artificial intelligence to create personalised learning systems for students with autism and learning disabilities. But also for students in higher education, you might be surprised to find that students in higher education aren't always engaged in the learning process. So I've developed projects on educational robotics on serious games, and more recently on digital game based making as well, not just using games, but making games as well. More recently, we have another ESRC funded project. And I'm looking at the well being of young students in education. So again, we use sensor data that might be we're co creating objects, which are networked that children use in schools and the sensor data that can interpret their level of anxiety and we can then introduce non medicalised approaches to intervene. So we're looking at personalised learning systems, virtual reality, augmented reality, robotics, game making, and well being.","How might the Department for Education's EdTech grants for schools improve the overall effectiveness of teacher professional development programs in disadvantaged schools?

"The philosophy and spirit of Notre-Dame Saint-Roch School is oriented towards a global education that includes knowledge and values. To achieve this, we want to offer a school that educates as well as teaches.
As parents, you are the first educators of your children: the responsibility for educational training lies partly with the school, but it can only complement what each child receives at home. Your active participation is essential to create a real harmony between family education and school education. Naturally, this creates a relationship of trust and dialogue between the educational team and you as parents.
Our project is to be a school that makes all its pupils succeed, without forgetting that there are diverse successes and diverse paths to fulfilment.
We take into account and scrupulously respect the official instructions and the programs established by the National Education, and within this framework our project is to :
""Our students are the future God has entrusted to us""
(Remarks of Monsignor Lustiger to the heads of schools in Paris at the dawn of the third millennium).
in cycle 1

The Aides-Maternelles (ASEM) provide effective assistance in working in workshops and help each child to learn to be independentt
In the basic learning cycle, our aim is for each pupil to :
In cycle 2
IN cycle 3
In the in-depth cycle, our objective is for each student to communicate, read, write, create and become a citizen:
to make people want to read by offering a varied choice of books, by going to the library, by explaining the choice of book, by being a reader for the little ones
to encourage writing by creating a newspaper about cultural activities or outings and by using computers
encourage self-expression by participating in group debates, presenting and critiquing presentations, taking part in competitions or ‘outside’ events
reading a children’s newspaper
cultural outings: visits to museums, theatres, concerts, etc.

politeness: speaking and respecting others’ words

In order to achieve these objectives and to succeed in the mission of giving your child a complete education in accordance with our values, we have set up a pedagogical organisation to respond to the diversity of the students.
Within each class, the teacher in charge proposes :
We are aware that it is important for you, as parents, to have a clear and regular overview of the progress of your children’s work. To this end, we have set up a personalised follow-up during the school year. This is structured as follows:
IN cycle 1
We start in the kindergarten section, where a personal follow-up is set up for your child.
Your child receives an evaluation booklet at the end of the year which shows what he/she has learned and what he/she still needs to learn or is learning.
IN cycles 2 et 3
The graded assessment is implemented, which allows your children to be assessed according to the objective of the common base of knowledge.
These graded assessments are included in the report cards which will be given to you every six weeks and before each school holiday.
The need for an alternative approach to measuring your child’s personal development is appreciated and assessed in the skills booklet given to families.
Our experience has shown us that if a child’s success is visible through his good grades and his motivation to go to school, it can only really be measured at the end of his physical, intellectual and spiritual development. Their capacity for adaptability and openness to the world will enable them to become the citizens of tomorrow with confidence.

"By the Greek word paradigm (example) we mean a pattern or example to be followed in a given situation. The American physicist and philosopher Thomas Samuel Kuhn (1922-1996) defines paradigms as “scientific advances that generate models that, for a period of time, guide the subsequent development of research that provides solutions to the problems presented.” The educational paradigm is a model used in education and aims to find the most appropriate way to teach the new generations, which differs from that of the previous generations.
In his nineteenth-century magnum opus, Arthur Schopenhauer notes the idea that all truths go through three stages: in the first they are met with ridicule, in the second they encounter violent resistance, and in the third they are accepted. Decades later, and not entirely unrelated, H.F. Lovecraft for the first time defines the fear of the unknown as a fundamental fear, seeing it as the oldest and strongest of all fears.
The lifespan of all readers of this review, regardless of their generational affiliation, is characterized by daily radical changes and re-reminders of the views of these thinkers. Inevitably, one of the most vivid examples of the rise of the new and the unknown is the dizzying advances in information technology and digital transformation. In the era of technocapitalism and accelerating globalization, digitalization is increasingly being treated as a paradigm for reformulating human value systems and needs. In that sense, the digital transformation in the field of education is a paradigm of teaching reforms and an answer to the question of how to learn in the future.
The recently adopted educational reforms, which go beyond the “one subject-one textbook” principle and instead provide for the practice of open educational resources and the transition of didactic materials from printed to digital format, probably confirm the mentioned philosophical insights. The reactions of resistance, directed mainly to the digitalization of textbooks, are numerous and, of course, expected and understandable: finally, this reform is deep and far-reaching and with its sharpness and novelty undermines the traditional way of learning for decades based in our educational worldview. However, although some of the criticisms must be considered as a quality introduction to a constructive discussion on the digitalization of textbooks, many of the reactions come down to emotional tirades without much argument.
However, the efforts to refute and reason the unargued reactions must start with a reasoned approach and proven and solid postulates, because only in this way these modern and extremely positive educational reforms will gain legitimacy before the citizens who are affected. In that direction, it is necessary for the entire planning process to be realized with a multi-perspective approach.
The Ministry of Education and Science should present a detailed assessment of the envisaged technical and infrastructural challenges and concrete proposals for overcoming them. At the same time, a sound plan is needed for the dynamics of the implementation of this reform. Of course, the support of teachers is of great importance in this process, who, as direct implementers of change, should be provided with adequate preparation and training for professional development, including the reform of the relevant university curricula for the education of future teachers.
These goals are high and, in order to achieve them, the Government of the Republic of Northern Macedonia will have to offer more than declarative support for the reforms in the overall education. The fact that, according to a number of measurable indicators, the country has one of the lowest budgeted education systems in Europe, and arguably the most unfavorable results in international testing, is a sufficient indicator of the level of commitment required in primary, secondary and higher education. to increase confidence in progressive change and to more easily see all the benefits that modernization brings.

The American physicist and philosopher Thomas Samuel Kuhn (1922-1996) defines paradigms as “scientific advances that generate models that, for a period of time, guide the subsequent development of research that provides solutions to the problems presented.” The educational paradigm is a model used in education and aims to find the most appropriate way to teach the new generations, which differs from that of the previous generations.
In his nineteenth-century magnum opus, Arthur Schopenhauer notes the idea that all truths go through three stages: in the first they are met with ridicule, in the second they encounter violent resistance, and in the third they are accepted. Decades later, and not entirely unrelated, H.F. Lovecraft for the first time defines the fear of the unknown as a fundamental fear, seeing it as the oldest and strongest of all fears.
The lifespan of all readers of this review, regardless of their generational affiliation, is characterized by daily radical changes and re-reminders of the views of these thinkers. Inevitably, one of the most vivid examples of the rise of the new and the unknown is the dizzying advances in information technology and digital transformation. In the era of technocapitalism and accelerating globalization, digitalization is increasingly being treated as a paradigm for reformulating human value systems and needs. In that sense, the digital transformation in the field of education is a paradigm of teaching reforms and an answer to the question of how to learn in the future.
The recently adopted educational reforms, which go beyond the “one subject-one textbook” principle and instead provide for the practice of open educational resources and the transition of didactic materials from printed to digital format, probably confirm the mentioned philosophical insights. The reactions of resistance, directed mainly to the digitalization of textbooks, are numerous and, of course, expected and understandable: finally, this reform is deep and far-reaching and with its sharpness and novelty undermines the traditional way of learning for decades based in our educational worldview. However, although some of the criticisms must be considered as a quality introduction to a constructive discussion on the digitalization of textbooks, many of the reactions come down to emotional tirades without much argument.
However, the efforts to refute and reason the unargued reactions must start with a reasoned approach and proven and solid postulates, because only in this way these modern and extremely positive educational reforms will gain legitimacy before the citizens who are affected. In that direction, it is necessary for the entire planning process to be realized with a multi-perspective approach.
The Ministry of Education and Science should present a detailed assessment of the envisaged technical and infrastructural challenges and concrete proposals for overcoming them. At the same time, a sound plan is needed for the dynamics of the implementation of this reform. Of course, the support of teachers is of great importance in this process, who, as direct implementers of change, should be provided with adequate preparation and training for professional development, including the reform of the relevant university curricula for the education of future teachers.
These goals are high and, in order to achieve them, the Government of the Republic of Northern Macedonia will have to offer more than declarative support for the reforms in the overall education. The fact that, according to a number of measurable indicators, the country has one of the lowest budgeted education systems in Europe, and arguably the most unfavorable results in international testing, is a sufficient indicator of the level of commitment required in primary, secondary and higher education. to increase confidence in progressive change and to more easily see all the benefits that modernization brings.

"This discussion group will look at some of the questions we need to ask ourselves to evaluate the use of technology in the classroom and ensure that it is used to enhance teaching practice and improve the education of students.
All too often, the tools of educational technology are used to ‘drive‘ and define the educational enterprise. We use tools because we can and are expected to, rather than because they help us meet educational objectives. The means become the end. This workshop will, through its participants, identify and offer an educational critique of some current uses of technology. It will first ask participants to identify some examples of educational technology use. Then, in small groups, participants will develop some educational tasks with specified objectives, assumptions and learning outcomes, together with the technological tools that could be used to assist in this. We will then analyze and discuss these, paying particular attention to educational rationales for using the technology and the real contributions it can make to learning. The ultimate purpose is to develop simple classification systems designed to help educators make well-informed judgements of the educational value in using technology.
How is technology changing the way teachers teach and children learn in our schools today? What skills does a teacher need in this new technological world? Do we need to teach any facts when we can “Google” and find out anything we need to know in an instant? Mobile phones are computers with cameras, voice recorders, web browsers, radios, audio players, organisers, etc. Should school students be using them in class? And what about exams, should students be able to use computers in all exams?
This interactive workshop will give participants the opportunity to discuss these questions, to consider how technology is changing education and examine its impact on our schools.
Claude Alvares will take a two-hour interactive workshop on “Nurturing Creativity”. A fixed, unchanging curriculum (and hidden curriculum) requires certain things to be “done” to the student. The teacher is appointed to ensure that the content of the curriculum is somehow lodged into the students’ heads. A successful teacher for any school administration is anyone who can do this task most effectively. However, creativity by definition deals with open-ended ideas and concepts. This naturally is in huge conflict with pre-set courses and content where creativity is at a minimum since the task demanded is comprehension and retention (mugging, if we are to speak frankly). The formal school today is criticised – and rightly so – for killing creativity. Since a large number of youngsters are involved, creativity gets a bashing on a colossal scale. Teachers claim that they have no time for creativity issues since the business of education is certification. Schools certify acquisition of knowledge and have no scope for creating new knowledge. The challenge is: Can schools nurture creativity and how? Will schools always kill creativity because this is the way they are organised to function or is there a chance that we can ensure transmission of necessary social knowledge and skills while protecting and nurturing the creative mind?
Why am I learning? Why do I have to go to school? Have you ever asked yourselves these questions or heard your children ask you? Often parents, at a loss for words, may respond and say, “because everyone goes to school.” At TNS, the staff dissects these questions and gives children an opportunity to be involved in and, to some extent ‘direct‘ their own learning and apply it in meaningful ways. Through class videos and portfolios of real work, we will see constructivism at work and an opportunity to learn some of the basics of project-based learning to get you started within your own classroom, school or community. Two of TNS’s past projects will be highlighted and there will be videos demonstrating teaching and learning. Challenges of project-based learning will be highlighted to help participants understand and hopefully avoid obvious pitfalls.

Often parents, at a loss for words, may respond and say, “because everyone goes to school.” At TNS, the staff dissects these questions and gives children an opportunity to be involved in and, to some extent ‘direct‘ their own learning and apply it in meaningful ways. Through class videos and portfolios of real work, we will see constructivism at work and an opportunity to learn some of the basics of project-based learning to get you started within your own classroom, school or community. Two of TNS’s past projects will be highlighted and there will be videos demonstrating teaching and learning. Challenges of project-based learning will be highlighted to help participants understand and hopefully avoid obvious pitfalls.
What is child initiated inquiry learning? How can children direct their own learning? How do we as teachers provide an environment to facilitate, maintain and extend inquiry? What is the role of the teacher? We will discuss how building on the strengths and interests of children in inquiry enables effective cross-curricular links. How is learning contextualised and made meaningful across subject “areas”? During this workshop we will discuss and share examples of inquiry learning and how it can be documented through group and individual narrative assessments (or learning stories) in order to celebrate and share learning and development with children and their parents.",How can teachers balance providing guidance and scaffolding to students while still allowing them to take ownership of their learning and make decisions about their inquiry projects?

Educational Technology promotes success
All across the planet, from different latitudes where ZARZA has settled Engineers, we have received and developed significant experiences with institutions of all academic grades. Now we are currently working on complex virtual education models, entirely based on remote classes, remembering us how for over the past 10 years we have been implementing systems for schools, colleges and Institutions of Higher Education, to improve their users’ care and education.
Educational Technology has exploded since it’s early progress over half a century ago, being today a phenomenon that has completely reached our children and young people, who have changed pencil and paper for tablets and laptops, carrying with them powerful memories, instead of heavy books that compromised their backs plus other physical conditions.
Today, the Educational Technology’s promotion has succeeded in diversifying teaching with dynamic activities, covering more information in less time; as demanded by the world we live in now.
Challenges of Professionals, from traditional to digital
It is and has been extremely rewarding to participate in processes worldwide, when technologists, educators and ZARZA Engineers are raising successful strategies, mixing the added knowledge of generations of educators with the “new”, the digital, what keeps the attention of those who today are completely digital natives.
In this process, teachers and students are challenged to assume with positivism the change of a new era, when Educational Technology means so much emotion, as responsibility and willingness to do something good, something much better.
Among the organizational challenges there’s always the administration and monitoring of agendas and databases, as well as care of the contents accessible from the institution’s installations, being this an opportunity to address as a second home, social and communitary issues that used to pass completely unnoticed.

And have you have you got anything to share with us in terms of examples that you might have come across?
I can give a couple of so I said that we've announced some funding for grantees edtech organisations that are working in a range of different areas. I think the first point I'd make is that usually, I think technology has a role to play in tackling social mobility where it supports great teaching. So I don't think technology on its own can do this. We were talking just before we started around a school, you mentioned in Blackpool that had really embedded iPads into their learning. And I'm sure there was some fantastic programs on that iPads that children could use, that teachers could use. But I guarantee that it wasn't that alone, that it was that those iPads were helping teachers teach brilliantly saving their time, so they had more time to put to the things that really mattered. So I think when we're talking about social mobility and technology, I do think it's essential that we're looking at technology as a support for great teaching and learning. Some of the tools I would say about actually as an example for for that I think there's we're working with organisations that are one trying to tackle formative assessment. So such an important element of teaching being able to give great feedback. So I was working with a few organisations that are supporting schools to save time on their assessment but also support great feedback. People like HegartyMaths is fantastic, Seneca, Pobble. All of these are working with schools to to kind of help that teaching process. Another really key element we think, is parental engagement. We speak to schools all the time. And I know from my own work as a school governor, how difficult it is to engage with some of those hard to reach parents, parents who might be working two jobs, who don't have normal working patterns, who might have had bad experiences with the education system. And we're exploring this with several organisations that are making it much easier for parents to access to access information about the school in a more accessible way. So an example on that is free flow info. So they work in a number of schools are doing things that are really different. So just different ways of engaging different kinds of parents. So I think that's another key one. And another thing you mentioned was accessibility. So we, I think one key thing is that all technology I think we've already heard should be accessible to all students. So students with learning difficulties often are left behind from technology products, which don't see it as their top priority. And I think it should be it should be a priority for every single technology product out there. And schools and people like us should be pushing them further to make sure that that is a key priority. And somebody who's here today actually, mangahigh, a maths assessment tool, and we're supporting them with some funding to make sure that everything that they have on offer can be ready and available for SEND schools. So a few examples, not too many plugs, I hope, some helpful advice as well.

Professor David Brown","What strategies would be effective in reducing the digital divide among students with disabilities in higher education, ensuring that they have equal access to online learning resources and course materials?"
"UNESCO data show that 20% of children ages 6 to 11 are out of school, and 60% of those above age 15 are excluded from the educational system. Many school systems have fees that are burdensome for families which, according to the World Bank, can lead to further exclusion. Students in rural areas face even more challenges: schools are harder to access, tend to have less infrastructure, and have fewer well-trained teachers. Sub-Saharan Africa is also host to a dazzling array of languages, which makes creating quality curricula a challenge.
Despite these challenges, this region is filled with driven innovators who recognise that access to quality education is a form of empowerment for both the children they help and the communities those children are in. Among the 2024 Global Collection, ACE Radio School, Shupavu291, TAW Academy’s Board Games, and Chalkboard Guides stand out as examples of how barriers can be broken down, education can be democratized, communities can be strengthened, and gaps can be bridged by using precisely chosen initiatives that are cost effective and respect local knowledge. So how can we leverage everyday tools - a radio, a text message, a chalkboard and a board game - to make a big impact?
Breaking Down Barriers
Eno Simon, Head of Office at ACE Charities, shows how the barriers to education can compound: “Nigeria has the highest rate of out-of-school children in the world. They’re out of school for so many reasons.… Even if you have traditional classroom education, families cannot pay the fees. They don’t feel safe letting their children go to school, and even when they get to school, sometimes you have poorly motivated teachers who don’t show up. And sometimes you don’t even have the resources.” Her team considered ways to make education accessible even in the face of these challenges. They needed an innovation that made quality education available - even free - to students while in the safety of their own homes.
ACE lessons take place in local communities and in local languages
Their solution? ACE Radio School, which brings school to their students, honouring their situations and giving them a space to continue their education. Eno explains: “We have provided access to quality learning that is free and safe because it happens in their local community, accessible by radio. Everybody has radio, even parents with regular phones have the radio component so they can access learning in their local languages.” The programme, which airs three times a week across four radio stations, hires teachers from the top private schools to formulate the lessons and has furnished education to nearly 36,000 students across 10 states.
But Eno emphasises that radio lessons are an opening: “We find an increased interest in formal education. Some people have been to school but they dropped out… But when the experience is radio school, it inspires their interest to go back to school.”
Of course, students who are in school need support as well. While teacher training improves, Shupavu291 and Chalkboard Guides take two different paths to democratising education.
In Kenya, mobile phone subscriptions are quite common - as of 2021 there are 1.25 mobile phone accounts per resident. Eneza Education realised that this could be an easy way to provide tutoring and educational content at low cost to their users. They paired with Safaricom to create Shupavu291, a mobile learning platform accessible entirely through SMS, with lessons, quizzes and assignments aligned to the Kenyan national curriculum. But they also have access to much broader support: students are matched to teachers who respond in real-time to their questions, and they can access Wikipedia by texting the platform for more information. The scale of this innovation is staggering: they have already delivered nearly 80 million lessons and the students who engage with them perform 23% higher on tests.
Lessons from Chalkboard Guides are rigorous and easy to follow for teachers and students
Shupavu291 provides students with high quality tutoring on demand. Chalkboard Guides, on the other hand, works to make classroom teaching more effective. Justice Rising’s Chief Technical Officer Ee-Reh Owo shares why an intervention in teaching methods is urgent: “It's well-known that too many children are not achieving basic literacy and numeracy. But in Sub-Saharan Africa, where according to the World Bank, 89% of 10 year olds cannot read and understand a simple text, students in conflict zones learn six times slower than even their peers who are affected by other types of crisis.” Justice Rising found that structured pedagogy solutions based on best practices were impactful in improving educational outcomes, but teachers did not have the bandwidth to properly implement them. Chalkboard Guides was developed with an eye to Cognitive Load Theory, which stresses the importance of predictable routines and learning in manageable chunks, especially during stressful situations.","How can policymakers balance the need for standardized curriculum with the importance of local language and cultural context in education, particularly in regions with high rates of out-of-school children and limited access to quality education?"

Eneza Education realised that this could be an easy way to provide tutoring and educational content at low cost to their users. They paired with Safaricom to create Shupavu291, a mobile learning platform accessible entirely through SMS, with lessons, quizzes and assignments aligned to the Kenyan national curriculum. But they also have access to much broader support: students are matched to teachers who respond in real-time to their questions, and they can access Wikipedia by texting the platform for more information. The scale of this innovation is staggering: they have already delivered nearly 80 million lessons and the students who engage with them perform 23% higher on tests.
Lessons from Chalkboard Guides are rigorous and easy to follow for teachers and students
Shupavu291 provides students with high quality tutoring on demand. Chalkboard Guides, on the other hand, works to make classroom teaching more effective. Justice Rising’s Chief Technical Officer Ee-Reh Owo shares why an intervention in teaching methods is urgent: “It's well-known that too many children are not achieving basic literacy and numeracy. But in Sub-Saharan Africa, where according to the World Bank, 89% of 10 year olds cannot read and understand a simple text, students in conflict zones learn six times slower than even their peers who are affected by other types of crisis.” Justice Rising found that structured pedagogy solutions based on best practices were impactful in improving educational outcomes, but teachers did not have the bandwidth to properly implement them. Chalkboard Guides was developed with an eye to Cognitive Load Theory, which stresses the importance of predictable routines and learning in manageable chunks, especially during stressful situations.","How can a school in a conflict zone use a combination of language and instructional strategies to increase student motivation and reduce dropout rates, while also addressing the psychological trauma caused by the conflict?"
"UNESCO data show that 20% of children ages 6 to 11 are out of school, and 60% of those above age 15 are excluded from the educational system. Many school systems have fees that are burdensome for families which, according to the World Bank, can lead to further exclusion. Students in rural areas face even more challenges: schools are harder to access, tend to have less infrastructure, and have fewer well-trained teachers. Sub-Saharan Africa is also host to a dazzling array of languages, which makes creating quality curricula a challenge.
Despite these challenges, this region is filled with driven innovators who recognise that access to quality education is a form of empowerment for both the children they help and the communities those children are in. Among the 2024 Global Collection, ACE Radio School, Shupavu291, TAW Academy’s Board Games, and Chalkboard Guides stand out as examples of how barriers can be broken down, education can be democratized, communities can be strengthened, and gaps can be bridged by using precisely chosen initiatives that are cost effective and respect local knowledge. So how can we leverage everyday tools - a radio, a text message, a chalkboard and a board game - to make a big impact?
Breaking Down Barriers
Eno Simon, Head of Office at ACE Charities, shows how the barriers to education can compound: “Nigeria has the highest rate of out-of-school children in the world. They’re out of school for so many reasons.… Even if you have traditional classroom education, families cannot pay the fees. They don’t feel safe letting their children go to school, and even when they get to school, sometimes you have poorly motivated teachers who don’t show up. And sometimes you don’t even have the resources.” Her team considered ways to make education accessible even in the face of these challenges. They needed an innovation that made quality education available - even free - to students while in the safety of their own homes.
ACE lessons take place in local communities and in local languages
Their solution? ACE Radio School, which brings school to their students, honouring their situations and giving them a space to continue their education. Eno explains: “We have provided access to quality learning that is free and safe because it happens in their local community, accessible by radio. Everybody has radio, even parents with regular phones have the radio component so they can access learning in their local languages.” The programme, which airs three times a week across four radio stations, hires teachers from the top private schools to formulate the lessons and has furnished education to nearly 36,000 students across 10 states.
But Eno emphasises that radio lessons are an opening: “We find an increased interest in formal education. Some people have been to school but they dropped out… But when the experience is radio school, it inspires their interest to go back to school.”

I think that's really true. That's a real potential downside of technology. Because every time we introduce new technology, virtual reality, AI machine learning, the money still tends to go to higher education. So I fight for money in Europe, to support technology in terms of educational technology for people with learning disabilities and autism. But still, the big money's still going to people who can afford to go to university. So social mobility in the past as we all know, was based on good education, and you can change your economic position or your social status. And when I went to university, I didn't have to take a loan. But now all of my students have to take a loan. And so what we're getting is people who can afford to pay afford to take the risk, and not people based on greatest merit. So I think it's a challenge to technologists, to create systems that are targeting people at risk of exclusion. And that's what we do. And there are good uses of virtual reality and AI, and machine learning, and you all know them. And we can also invest in good uses too. And that's what I think our aim should be, to address that point. There's a huge potential danger.
Do you want to chip in on that one?
I suppose, what I would add again, to go back to my high open, about employers have this duty to step up and get involved. And you know, thousands and thousands do is that is part of the solution. In the you know, we we spent a lot of our time encouraging our members to get involved and actually getting them to go to schools that need the help in college universities that need the help. So, you have phenomenons and I'm sorry to use a London example in Birmingham. But you know, you have a phenomenon where schools in Tower Hamlets will have bankers, accountants queuing up to help and there's a lot of their time to tell him to go away. And you then go only a half a mile down the road somewhere like Barking and there's nothing and actually it's very difficult for employers and charities to understand where are the cold spots as it were, how do you get your help to those that most needed not the ones that shout the loudest or are closest, so I was very struck actually by a speech by Damien Hinds when he when he was Secretary of State that he said that it when he first became Secretary of State, all of his civil servants planned out his diary to visit schools and colleges and all of the schools, colleges that he was visiting, were outstanding or good. And, I think there's a danger we all sort of slip into is that we will see the good, we will see the outstanding, and I hope whoever is the next Education Secretary will continue what Damien Hinds spoke about and actually commit entirely to helping the cold spots, not the official cold spots, which are somewhat arbitrary and somewhat confusing. The Northeast for instance, not having one despite having the highest of deprivation, but actually thinking about where the schools and colleges that need the most help, and how do we get the most money to them? How do we get employers to help them? And try to actually coordinate it because I, I think there is enough out there, there is you know, we spend above the average education. And we have very, very enthusiastic employers. And yet we still have disadvantaged gaps and other problems. So I think a huge part of the answers question is just better coordination, and focusing all the efforts as much as we can.","How might the incorporation of virtual reality technology into a university curriculum help to address the issue of students from disadvantaged backgrounds feeling less connected to the campus community and more likely to drop out?

Interactive, immersive training in education is also a part of these modalities to promote the involvement and engagement of learners. This could involve simulations and situations that let students use their knowledge in a real-world setting and get rapid feedback.
3. Make it Realistic

Make sure that the type of immersive learning experience you are offering for educational purposes is accessible to all. All learners, including those with disabilities, should be able to participate in immersive learning experiences. This can involve making the platform compatible with assistive technology and offering different formats for students with visual or aural impairments.
5. Include Social Learning Aspects
To encourage student cooperation and knowledge sharing, immersive learning should include social learning opportunities. This may entail including forums, collaborative projects, and peer review exercises.
Immersive Learning vs Experiential Learning
Immersive learning is an educational approach that immerses students in a virtual or physical environment that simulates real-world scenarios. It is designed to help learners better understand and retain information by actively engaging them in learning. Examples of immersive learning include virtual reality, augmented reality, and simulation-based learning.
Experiential learning is an educational approach that emphasizes the hands-on exploration of concepts and skills. It allows learners to apply knowledge and skills in a practical setting and explore real-world problems. Examples of experimental learning include field trips, problem-based learning, and internships.

Interactive, immersive training in education is also a part of these modalities to promote the involvement and engagement of learners. This could involve simulations and situations that let students use their knowledge in a real-world setting and get rapid feedback.
3. Make it Realistic
The most natural settings should be used for creating immersive learning experiences. This can involve including true-to-life situations, simulations, and environments to aid learners in acquiring the abilities and information required to succeed in practical settings.
Make sure that the type of immersive learning experience you are offering for educational purposes is accessible to all. All learners, including those with disabilities, should be able to participate in immersive learning experiences. This can involve making the platform compatible with assistive technology and offering different formats for students with visual or aural impairments.
5. Include Social Learning Aspects
To encourage student cooperation and knowledge sharing, immersive learning should include social learning opportunities. This may entail including forums, collaborative projects, and peer review exercises.
Immersive Learning vs Experiential Learning
Immersive learning is an educational approach that immerses students in a virtual or physical environment that simulates real-world scenarios. It is designed to help learners better understand and retain information by actively engaging them in learning. Examples of immersive learning include virtual reality, augmented reality, and simulation-based learning.
Experiential learning is an educational approach that emphasizes the hands-on exploration of concepts and skills. It allows learners to apply knowledge and skills in a practical setting and explore real-world problems. Examples of experimental learning include field trips, problem-based learning, and internships.
Immersive learning primarily aims to provide learners with a realistic setting that simulates. real-world events. The goal is to assist learners in acquiring knowledge and skills in a secure and controlled environment, free of the risks associated with real-world circumstances.","How can educators effectively balance the need for realism in immersive learning with the potential risks of exposing students to sensitive or disturbing content, while still achieving the learning objectives?"
"Even though the technology is beneficial, there are also some disadvantages to the concept. Have a look below:
1. Potential of Over-Reliance
The overuse of immersive learning technologies might hinder the growth of other abilities, including communication, critical thinking, and problem-solving. Being immersed in a virtual world puts expressions, body language and some other human cues on hindsight, making interactions lesser effective. This questions the stability of these virtual learning environments.
2. Highly Skilled Workforce
All types of immersive learning technologies are worked on and handled by highly experienced and skilled professionals. Consequently, without the people involved, these technologies would not be as effective in aiding any learning experience.
3. Learning Outcomes
Relying on immersive learning environments could cause students to get preoccupied with the devices rather than the learning process, making the learning process suffer. Moreover, there is no actual evidence that using immersive learning technologies improve learning outcomes or the process.
4. Safety Concerns
A virtual environment could cause certain users to experience physical or psychological harm, like nausea, migraines, dizziness, or balance problems. Virtual reality headsets, 3D glasses, controllers, or earbuds could also make you prone to pathogens that can spread between users who use the same devices. Moreover, some users claim that they experience momentary fuzziness, lightheadedness, or dream-like states after being immersed in a virtual environment.
5. Limited Real-World Applicability
Immersive learning experiences don't always translate to practical situations. These settings can be helpful for practice and feedback. Still, they might need to accurately reflect the complexity of actual situations. This may reduce how well the training prepares students for real-world job settings.
Best Practices for Effective Learning
Effective Learning with Immersive Learning in education is possible with the following practices:
1. Define Learning Objectives
Establishing the learning objectives in detail is crucial before developing an immersive learning experience. This will make it easier to ensure that the training aligns with the targeted results and that learners know what is expected of them. It will not only help in achieving your goals faster but also helps in testing your progress.

"- Fourth, create personal relevance. All students have individual interests: those things they come into your classroom caring about. They also have situational interests: the things they’re motivated to care about because of the enthusiasm and passion of their teachers and peers. Both these areas are rich sources of goals that help students understand the meaning behind their learning.
- Goal Setting in Action: Whether a student is interested in frogs, robotics, or videos and animation, finding ways to allow students to bring those interests with them into the classroom helps them connect with what they’re learning. The reading teacher who helped a student engage with his interest in frogs while learning valuable reading skills was creating personal relevance.
- Fifth, use student choice. While not all students will be ready to set their own goals today, the ultimate objective is that all students take control of what and how they learn. To get them there, provide students meaningful choices over the activities they engage in, the academic areas they focus on, or the ways they show mastery in a subject. With their personal goal in hand, a student can focus on their individual learning and over time build the ownership they need to continue learning over the course of their lifetime.
- Goal Setting in Action: Some examples of supporting student choice are active listening, allowing independent time for goal setting and reflection, and reminding students of the hard work and progress they’ve already achieved. Encouraging students to be part of creating their own goals and reflecting on those goals more deeply connects students to those goals.
In many ways, technology is the “force multiplier” that can make this all possible. A classroom with one or two educators can’t reasonably expect an adult to guide five to 10 different activities at once, all reaching students from where they are. Providing meaningful activities where students can self-direct their learning allows them to practice key knowledge, apply knowledge in new situations, and work with standards at greater complexity while freeing teachers to focus on students who most need direct intervention.
Starting with Small Steps
A school culture where all members are focused on helping students achieve meaningful and ambitious goals — what some researchers call “academic press” (Leithwood and Sun, 2018) — won’t emerge overnight. While changing a culture seems complicated, it really is nothing more than the sum of a thousand small actions that communicate a common message to students, teachers, and leaders.
Even if your classroom or school can’t take on a full goal-setting practice today, little changes like providing students with opportunities to break down academic standards into their own words, or to discuss their areas of focus for an academic year, can begin to plant a culture focused on student growth.
Workshops never begin with all their tools in exactly the right place. As you progress from beginner to expert in any craft, you find the tools and workstations that meet your needs, and the most effective workshop begins to take shape.
The workshop classroom will also emerge over time. As you go to find your tools, consider what your group of young makers is ready for, where their skills lie, and what they ultimately want to build. Combining these tools with the techniques that direct them toward the right ends will help make sure learning in your workshop creates growth, builds motivation, and reinforces student agency.

"Since a recent NAEP study has shown a tight correlation between vocabulary and reading comprehension, some of the challenges facing the U.S. today are to greatly reduce the number of families living in poverty, educate all parents and daycare caregivers about the importance of talking to children in meaningful ways from birth on, and bring equity to under-resourced schools.
Poverty and achievement
It’s difficult to comprehend that the U.S., the wealthiest nation in the world, cannot significantly reduce the amount of poverty and raise the achievement levels of all children. Or that federal and state departments of education have failed to factor into their reform policies the significance of our high poverty rate, the lack of equity in education, and the relationship of poverty and inequity to children’s ability to learn and achieve.
Most of the lowest achieving schools in the U.S. have the highest number of disadvantaged students and are under-resourced. Yet, the thinking that is shaping education policy today seems to be that greater accountability, more “rigorous” curriculum standards, and tougher tests are sufficient to produce better teaching, higher test scores and “success for all.” Nowhere is the issue of poverty even acknowledged in current government initiatives.
Certainly the educators who work in state and federal education departments know better – many of them have worked in such communities and schools. But too often, a code of silence prevails in the face of misguided political decisions.
With the professed belief among policy makers and advisors that stricter accountability for teachers and administrators can reverse our downward reading-score trend, a national culture of blame and finger pointing has arisen. States have adopted regressive policies that tie teachers’ and administrators’ evaluations to students’ test scores, possibly affecting job security and punishing schools in high poverty communities by labeling them as “failing.”
Such accountability ignores the fact that every student can make progress, but not every student can meet the one-size-progress-for-all goal set by state departments of education. In this punitive and negative climate, it can become increasingly difficult to find teachers willing to work with English language learners, special education students, and high-poverty populations who can, and do, improve but often don’t meet mandated progress levels.
We admonish teachers to not teach to the test. Yet their evaluations of job performance depend on the annual test scores. So, of course teachers will teach to the tests, even though doing so adversely affects all children’s education by diminishing creative, innovative, and critical thinking.
Suppressing creative and critical thinking
At the College of William and Mary in Virginia, Dr. Kyung Hee Kim, an educational psychologist, started a study of creativity test results in 1990 and published her findings in 2011. Dr. Kim revealed a significant decrease in the creativity scores of children in kindergarten through grade six in the United States.
As Dr. Kim described in the 2012 Torrance Lecture at the University of Georgia College of Education, creativity scores, which had been on the rise prior to 1990 and prior to the No Child Left Behind and Reading First initiatives, have been steadily falling for the past two decades.
Dr. Kim’s study also showed that the relationship between IQ and creativity is small. According to Dr. Kim, creativity requires a climate and attitude where teachers and parents support students to play, explore new ideas, and experience a combination of convergent and divergent thinking.
Creative children can generate a wide range of ideas to solve problems. In particular, divergent thinking is the aspect of creativity that future generations will need to solve problems of war and genocide and fast-spreading diseases like Ebola.
The play and exploration in active learning environments that education philosopher and psychologist John Dewey described more than a century ago mirror the ways that children learn and develop creative, divergent thinking. It’s by doing, by pretending and role-playing, by listening to dozens of books read each day and discussing and dramatizing them, by engaging in meaningful conversations, by collaborative and generative problem solving, painting, dancing, and music, that children develop creativity.
With the onset of state and Common Core tests, our nation has adopted teaching practices that deter creative thinking and innovation. In an effort to improve reading scores, play as a way of exploring and learning has been greatly reduced in preschool. Instead, three- and four-year-olds spend their time learning the alphabet, studying letter-sound relationships and sight words, and developing phonemic awareness skills – in lieu of engaging in play as a way to understand concepts, group and classify items, and problem-solve.","How can policymakers design a national strategy to address the intersection of climate change and social inequality, taking into account the need for creative problem-solving and divergent thinking in addressing this complex issue?"

At the College of William and Mary in Virginia, Dr. Kyung Hee Kim, an educational psychologist, started a study of creativity test results in 1990 and published her findings in 2011. Dr. Kim revealed a significant decrease in the creativity scores of children in kindergarten through grade six in the United States.
As Dr. Kim described in the 2012 Torrance Lecture at the University of Georgia College of Education, creativity scores, which had been on the rise prior to 1990 and prior to the No Child Left Behind and Reading First initiatives, have been steadily falling for the past two decades.
Dr. Kim’s study also showed that the relationship between IQ and creativity is small. According to Dr. Kim, creativity requires a climate and attitude where teachers and parents support students to play, explore new ideas, and experience a combination of convergent and divergent thinking.
Creative children can generate a wide range of ideas to solve problems. In particular, divergent thinking is the aspect of creativity that future generations will need to solve problems of war and genocide and fast-spreading diseases like Ebola.
The play and exploration in active learning environments that education philosopher and psychologist John Dewey described more than a century ago mirror the ways that children learn and develop creative, divergent thinking. It’s by doing, by pretending and role-playing, by listening to dozens of books read each day and discussing and dramatizing them, by engaging in meaningful conversations, by collaborative and generative problem solving, painting, dancing, and music, that children develop creativity.
With the onset of state and Common Core tests, our nation has adopted teaching practices that deter creative thinking and innovation. In an effort to improve reading scores, play as a way of exploring and learning has been greatly reduced in preschool. Instead, three- and four-year-olds spend their time learning the alphabet, studying letter-sound relationships and sight words, and developing phonemic awareness skills – in lieu of engaging in play as a way to understand concepts, group and classify items, and problem-solve.","How can schools, policymakers, and parents work together to create a national culture that values and prioritizes early childhood education, such as through increased funding and support for play-based learning programs, in order to ultimately improve reading comprehension and vocabulary skills among disadvantaged students?"
"Since a recent NAEP study has shown a tight correlation between vocabulary and reading comprehension, some of the challenges facing the U.S. today are to greatly reduce the number of families living in poverty, educate all parents and daycare caregivers about the importance of talking to children in meaningful ways from birth on, and bring equity to under-resourced schools.
Poverty and achievement
It’s difficult to comprehend that the U.S., the wealthiest nation in the world, cannot significantly reduce the amount of poverty and raise the achievement levels of all children. Or that federal and state departments of education have failed to factor into their reform policies the significance of our high poverty rate, the lack of equity in education, and the relationship of poverty and inequity to children’s ability to learn and achieve.
Most of the lowest achieving schools in the U.S. have the highest number of disadvantaged students and are under-resourced. Yet, the thinking that is shaping education policy today seems to be that greater accountability, more “rigorous” curriculum standards, and tougher tests are sufficient to produce better teaching, higher test scores and “success for all.” Nowhere is the issue of poverty even acknowledged in current government initiatives.
Certainly the educators who work in state and federal education departments know better – many of them have worked in such communities and schools. But too often, a code of silence prevails in the face of misguided political decisions.
With the professed belief among policy makers and advisors that stricter accountability for teachers and administrators can reverse our downward reading-score trend, a national culture of blame and finger pointing has arisen. States have adopted regressive policies that tie teachers’ and administrators’ evaluations to students’ test scores, possibly affecting job security and punishing schools in high poverty communities by labeling them as “failing.”
Such accountability ignores the fact that every student can make progress, but not every student can meet the one-size-progress-for-all goal set by state departments of education. In this punitive and negative climate, it can become increasingly difficult to find teachers willing to work with English language learners, special education students, and high-poverty populations who can, and do, improve but often don’t meet mandated progress levels.

Please note that the question does not mention ""imagination"" or ""creative development"", but it requires expertise in the subtopic to provide a comprehensive answer."
"I think this is a really interesting question. And if we take it, if we're thinking about schools at this point, the way I'll answer this question, I think one thing first to say is I don't actually think there's a danger that technology is going to replace teachers in our school system here. I don't think that's going to happen. And our research that we've done at Nesta doesn't show that it's likely, if anything, it shows that teaching is likely to be the occupation that's most likely to grow through as our world changes. So I think if we kind of agree that we're going to still have a system where every young every person of school age can go to school, for free in a state education system with teachers. You know, of course, so we have a recruitment crisis. So perhaps not enough teachers, but I still think that resource is always going to be there. But then I think the access to technology for school aged children is really about individual schools and deciding how to use their budget. So there's huge funding pressures. And so that is one key barrier for lots of schools is a decision as to whether to buy hardware for schools and what technology to provide to students. Some schools choose to do it and some don't. And I, you know, I won't talk too much about that. But I think it's kind of at a school level. And I think one of the key challenges here is the fragmentation of our system. It's really difficult for technology companies to navigate their way around the school system, going door to door almost every school in the country trying to sell their products. And it's very difficult for schools to get the value for money that they want from technology because they often operate on their own or in very small multi Academy trust. Obviously, there's some that are in larger trust that might have some ability, but actually most schools are In a situation where they're quite on their own and need much more support and advice on on kind of purchasing technology and getting the best value, because then actually all of those students in that school regardless of their background would have access to it. So a school level, I think that's really one of the challenges.
Yeah, and that touches very clearly doesn't hit on a couple of the questions that we've got there. In terms of, you know, you've got a limited budget, how do you create a digital learning space that you think is or that you know, is right? Without taking a punt on it, and who's there to advise? And, you know, I remember in the dim and distant past, Vector being around as well, and they were, they were a decent source of advice. They were a good go to people. But I dare say that you'd say Nesta, get Nesta involved?
Well, yeah, I think one of the key thing obviously, I say that one of the key things I would say that we're really trying to support schools with is the evidence base. So unfortunately, you know, I don't have the school's budget if I did, I would obviously use it in a different way. Maybe but you know, without us giving more money to schools, of course, that's not something I have control over. But what we're trying to do is make sure that there's really good evidence for what works in technology, so that schools don't waste their budgets on things that end up not fulfilling their promises that end up in a cupboard the next kind of year when the teachers change over. So it's about having a really good informed evidence base for what technology can work in what context and using that. So the edtech testbed that I mentioned previously is going to be producing a whole range of evidence and we hope to produce evidence in other ways, and find the best way of disseminating that for the school system. So that's something we're still exploring and if people have ideas of how schools and and and teachers really want to find out that information, how can we make it as easy as possible then we're really open to ideas about that as well, but it's something we're really keen on.

But I dare say that you'd say Nesta, get Nesta involved?
Well, yeah, I think one of the key thing obviously, I say that one of the key things I would say that we're really trying to support schools with is the evidence base. So unfortunately, you know, I don't have the school's budget if I did, I would obviously use it in a different way. Maybe but you know, without us giving more money to schools, of course, that's not something I have control over. But what we're trying to do is make sure that there's really good evidence for what works in technology, so that schools don't waste their budgets on things that end up not fulfilling their promises that end up in a cupboard the next kind of year when the teachers change over. So it's about having a really good informed evidence base for what technology can work in what context and using that. So the edtech testbed that I mentioned previously is going to be producing a whole range of evidence and we hope to produce evidence in other ways, and find the best way of disseminating that for the school system. So that's something we're still exploring and if people have ideas of how schools and and and teachers really want to find out that information, how can we make it as easy as possible then we're really open to ideas about that as well, but it's something we're really keen on.
