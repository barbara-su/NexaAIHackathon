Radiation exposure can cause a range of health effects, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurological damage, which can occur years or even decades after exposure. In contrast, medication regimens used in treatment for various diseases can cause side effects such as nausea, fatigue, and hair loss, which are typically temporary and reversible.

Radiation exposure can also cause genetic mutations, which can be passed on to future generations, whereas medication regimens used in treatment for various diseases do not typically have this effect.

In terms of the differences between the two, radiation exposure is typically a one-time event, whereas medication regimens are ongoing and can be adjusted or changed over time. Radiation exposure can also be unpredictable and uncontrollable, whereas medication regimens are typically carefully planned and monitored by healthcare providers.

Overall, while both radiation exposure and medication regimens can have significant effects on the body, they differ in terms of their mechanisms, timing, and potential long-term consequences.","['https://www.epa.gov/radiation/radiation-health-effects', 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26251392/', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3080029/', 'https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(15)61167-9/fulltext', 'https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ionizing-radiation-and-health-effects', 'https://www.cdc.gov/radiation-emergencies/signs-symptoms/possible-health-effects.html', 'https://www.cancer.org/cancer/managing-cancer/treatment-types/radiation/effects-on-different-parts-of-body.html', 'https://19january2017snapshot.epa.gov/radiation/radiation-health-effects', 'https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/treatment/radiotherapy/side-effects/long-term-side-effects', 'https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/radiation-sickness/symptoms-causes/syc-20377058', 'https://www.cdc.gov/tb/topic/treatment/ltbi.htm', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2868342/', 'https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/wr/mm6645a2.htm', 'https://hivinfo.nih.gov/understanding-hiv/fact-sheets/what-start-choosing-hiv-treatment-regimen', 'https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2024/infections-diseases/malaria', 'https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/dangers-polypharmacy-and-case-deprescribing-older-adults', 'https://www.nature.com/articles/s41573-023-00670-0', 'https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2747871', 'https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/230802-treatment', 'https://liverfoundation.org/liver-diseases/viral-hepatitis/hepatitis-c/treating-hepatitis-c/', 'https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2019/bone-metastases-pain-single-radiation-dose', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7192027/', 'https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa0906260', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK563259/', 'https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199211193272102', 'https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/antivirals/summary-clinicians.htm', 'https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-18872-8', 'https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/chemotherapy-for-breast-cancer/about/pac-20384931', 'https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/124/3/344/33136/Conditioning-regimens-for-hematopoietic-cell', 'https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-her2-positive-breast-cancer-beyond-the-basics/print']",medical and clinical knowledge

"One must think, and probably agree, that there have been many changes in the teaching of medicine, throughout the decades up to the present time. However there might be debate as to how efficient the changes have been, or how necessary some changes have been. Keeping in mind, obviously, that ultimately it is the patient who is the final concern.
If we break down the teaching of medicine, we can reduce it to three broad categories of responsibilities and concern:
- One is the clinical information itself. This includes the discovering and identifying of disorders and diseases, the evolving applicable instrumentation and its proper use, and the diagnosing, treating and the evaluation of treatments.
- The second responsibility is the delivery or presentation of this information. For example the teachers and their individual personalities, their comfort zones in disseminating information, and the broad spectrum of evolving, appropriate technology, such as classroom electronics and online deliveries.
- The third is the target market (meaning the student) to whom the information is delivered.
The question we should be asking is, ""are we as efficiently concerned with changes in the ‘market’ as we have been with changes in the other two elements of medical education?”
Granted, from the earliest recorded medicine and the teaching of it, perhaps as far back as the 2nd millennium B.C. until today, there have been changes in medicine. Therefore, there had to be someone to learn from someone who knew and could teach, as well as someone to decide what to teach. The chances are that quite frequently these responsibilities were the responsibility of one individual (e.g. the teacher who knew the information and decided how to present it). The overall approach to teaching medicine has gone through change merely by evolving into the more ""democratic” system of today as opposed to the ancient, more traditional, master-apprentice paradigm of clinical medical training. Obviously, the mere numbers of students and available professors has dictated the need to stray from the older traditional education that began with ancient one-on-one education.
When considering changes in clinical information, some profound discoveries have revolutionized our knowledge base of medicine. Some that come to mind are; a) Harvey’s direct observations via dissection and his uncovering of the role of a closed circulatory system, with capillaries being the sites of exchanges, b) the identifying and studying of something called ""cancer,” c) Freud’s opening up of the mind, d) the value of Crawford Long’s application of diethyl ether, e) the profound value of the sterilization of objects or food, f) the ""genetic revolution” and g) the development of an absorbable suture and its effect on surgery. Every time a disease is identified, its pathophysiology worked out, and the treatment protocol discovered, a bell rings and medical schools are globally alerted to another inclusion in their training regimens. Obviously there are a myriad of innovations related to increasing our clinical information.

One of the most promising aspects of modern diagnostic techniques lies in the field of medical imaging. Advanced imaging technologies such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computerized tomography (CT) scans, and positron emission tomography (PET) scans have revolutionized the way doctors and medical professionals visualize the internal structures of the human body.
These technologies provide detailed, 3-dimensional images that allow for precise detection and localization of abnormalities, leading to early and accurate diagnosis.
In addition to imaging technologies, the rapid advancements in genomics have also been a game-changer in disease diagnosis. Genetic testing can now identify mutations linked to a multitude of diseases, including various types of cancers, cardiovascular disorders, and genetic syndromes.
These tests not only facilitate early detection but also help in predicting the risk of developing certain diseases, enabling preventative measures to be taken in a timely manner.","What are the implications of a person's genetic predisposition to develop a certain disease on their ability to participate in high-risk sports and activities, given the advancements in genetic testing and personalized medicine?","The implications of a person's genetic predisposition to develop a certain disease on their ability to participate in high-risk sports and activities are multifaceted and depend on various factors. The search results suggest that individuals with a genetic predisposition to certain diseases, such as coronary artery disease, may be at a higher risk of developing the disease if they engage in high-risk sports and activities. Additionally, genetic predisposition may also increase the risk of mental health disorders, such as eating disorders, and metabolic morbidities, such as obesity and Type 2 Diabetes. However, it is essential to note that not all individuals with a genetic predisposition will develop the disease, and that lifestyle factors, such as regular exercise and a healthy diet, can help mitigate the risk.","['https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30485117/', 'https://www.ncaa.org/sports/2014/11/4/mind-body-and-sport-eating-disorders.aspx', 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37703277/', 'https://www.ncaa.org/sports/2014/11/5/mind-body-and-sport-risk-factors-in-the-sport-environment.aspx', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8787794/', 'https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/what-is-alzheimers/causes-and-risk-factors', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4320608/', 'https://www.adrspine.com/insights/is-degenerative-disc-disease-hereditary', 'https://eurapa.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1007/s11556-010-0077-2', 'https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCGENETICS.114.000784', 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30485117/', 'https://www.ncaa.org/sports/2014/11/4/mind-body-and-sport-eating-disorders.aspx', 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37703277/', 'https://www.ncaa.org/sports/2014/11/5/mind-body-and-sport-risk-factors-in-the-sport-environment.aspx', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8787794/', 'https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/what-is-alzheimers/causes-and-risk-factors', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4320608/', 'https://www.adrspine.com/insights/is-degenerative-disc-disease-hereditary', 'https://eurapa.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1007/s11556-010-0077-2', 'https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCGENETICS.114.000784', 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30485117/', 'https://www.ncaa.org/sports/2014/11/4/mind-body-and-sport-eating-disorders.aspx', 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37703277/', 'https://www.ncaa.org/sports/2014/11/5/mind-body-and-sport-risk-factors-in-the-sport-environment.aspx', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8787794/', 'https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/what-is-alzheimers/causes-and-risk-factors', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4320608/', 'https://www.adrspine.com/insights/is-degenerative-disc-disease-hereditary', 'https://eurapa.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1007/s11556-010-0077-2', 'https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCGENETICS.114.000784']",medical and clinical knowledge

Treatment Options Fall Within Two Major Categories
The Traditional Western or Allopathic Medicine Options
- Over the counter or prescription drugs, which can have mild to serious and potentially deadly side effects. Prescription drug deaths total over 100,000/year.
- Surgery – The Lancet claims that the overall death rate for the two months following surgery is a staggering 1 in 28!
- Radiation – In the future, radiation treatment might be looked on in disbelief. The attempt of radiation is to try to kill the cancer before the healthy cells. (from WebMD)
- Psychiatry – Beware selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, which are antidepressants that have the potential side effects of suicide and homicide. This has been a hot topic of debate in recent years.
- Physical Therapy can be based on traditional medical principles or be more holistically oriented.
- Dentistry can also be based on more traditional or holistic approaches. Biological or holistic dentists have a more natural approach and don’t use amalgam fillings that are made of mercury and silver.
The Alternative, Holistic & Natural Healing Options
- Supplements, including; herbs, vitamins, minerals, probiotics, nutraceuticals and essential oils. I practice Science Based Nutrition, which uses supplements, food and lifestyle modifications rather than drugs to help the body to heal itself.
- Food Therapy – Utilizing healing foods. Here are 52 healing foods from Prevention Magazine.
- Exercise is Medicine – Exercise is therapeutic on many levels. Endurance, resistance training and flexibility training are 3 major categories. Exercise increases life expectancy and reduces stress. Exercise also reduces the odds of getting sick or injured and can be done at zero cost. Take a look at the Exercise is Medicine website.
- Chiropractic – This a method of healing that started in America in 1895. There are many systems of chiropractic, but the one that I prefer is Koren Specific Technique (KST).
- Osteopathy – This is another American method of healing that started in 1874. Please note that some osteopaths don’t do any manipulations any longer and are basically medical doctors. Here is some information about Osteopathy.
- Acupuncture – This is a Chinese method of healing that started well over 2,000 years ago. Very little was known about acupuncture in the United States before the 1960s. Here is a good source for more information about Acupuncture.
- Bodywork, including; massage, acupressure, tapping, hot stone therapy and more.
- Meditation – Meditation comes in many different forms and is practiced all over the world. Here is a source for more information.
- Yoga – Originated in India and can be traced back over 5,000 years and also involves meditation. Here is an interesting source for beginners.
- Homeopathy – This alternative method of healing started in Germany in 1796 that has been very controversial since its onset. Here is a source for additional information on Homeopathy.
- Energy Healing, includes many non-traditional techniques, one of which is reiki.
- Magnetic Healing – The therapeutic use of magnets has existed for thousands of years and is still another controversial treatment method. Many experts swear magnets do nothing and others, such as Dr. Mercola, beg to differ.
- Intuitive Healthcare is considered health quackery by some and others swear by it – Part of intuitive healthcare is diagnostic, by determining what is wrong without traditional methods. This can be done with the patient present or done remotely. The second step is intuitive healing. This can be a physical treatment, a natural prescription, may be attempted without any contact with the patient, as well as done remotely. This area of healthcare is one of the most controversial.

- Healing Prayer – Has been used for thousands of years by many religions to attempt to heal oneself as well as to heal others. Can prayer actually heal? WebMD chimes in and you may be surprised by what they have to say.",What is the most effective way to reduce the risk of developing a chronic disease while simultaneously improving mental health and increasing life expectancy for an individual who has a family history of heart disease and is currently diagnosed with mild depression?,"The most effective way to reduce the risk of developing a chronic disease while simultaneously improving mental health and increasing life expectancy for an individual with a family history of heart disease and mild depression is to adopt a comprehensive approach that incorporates lifestyle changes, stress management, and medical interventions.

Here are some multiple perspectives and a detailed breakdown:

1. Lifestyle Changes:
	* Regular physical activity: Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise, or a combination of both, per week. (Source: American Heart Association)
	* Healthy diet: Focus on whole, unprocessed foods, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. (Source: Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics)
	* Stress management: Engage in stress-reducing activities, such as meditation, yoga, or deep breathing exercises, for at least 30 minutes per day. (Source: National Institute of Mental Health)
2. Stress Management:
	* Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT): A type of talk therapy that helps individuals identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors. (Source: American Psychological Association)
	* Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR): A program that teaches individuals mindfulness techniques to reduce stress and improve mental health. (Source: University of Massachusetts Medical School)
3. Medical Interventions:
	* Medications: Antidepressants, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), can help manage symptoms of depression. (Source: National Institute of Mental Health)
	* Lifestyle counseling: Healthcare providers can offer personalized lifestyle advice and support to help individuals make healthy changes. (Source: American Heart Association)
4. Family History:
	* Genetic testing: Consider genetic testing to identify potential genetic risk factors for heart disease and other chronic conditions. (Source: National Institutes of Health)
	* Family history counseling: Healthcare providers can offer counseling and support to help individuals understand their family history and make informed decisions about their health. (Source: American Heart Association)

The benefits of combining OMT with conventional medical therapies include:

* Improved pain management: OMT can help to reduce chronic pain by releasing tension in the muscles and joints, and by improving circulation and reducing inflammation.
* Enhanced patient satisfaction: OMT can be a non-invasive and non-pharmacological approach to pain management, which can be appealing to patients who are looking for alternative treatments.
* Reduced risk of side effects: OMT is generally considered to be a safe and low-risk treatment, with few reported side effects.
* Increased patient engagement: OMT can be a hands-on and interactive approach to pain management, which can help to engage patients and promote active participation in their treatment.

The potential risks of combining OMT with conventional medical therapies include:

* Lack of standardization: OMT is a relatively new and evolving field, and there is currently a lack of standardization in terms of training, certification, and practice.
* Limited research: While there is some research on the effectiveness of OMT for chronic pain, more studies are needed to fully understand its benefits and risks.
* Potential for misdiagnosis: OMT is often used to treat musculoskeletal conditions, but it may not be effective for other types of chronic pain.
* Potential for over-reliance: OMT may be over-relied upon as a sole treatment for chronic pain, rather than being used in conjunction with other evidence-based treatments.

To weigh these factors, healthcare providers should consider the following:

* Patient preferences: Patients should be involved in the decision-making process and should be informed about the potential benefits and risks of OMT.
* Clinical evidence: Healthcare providers should review the available clinical evidence on the effectiveness of OMT for chronic pain and consider the limitations of the research.
* Patient characteristics: Healthcare providers should consider the individual characteristics of each patient, including their medical history, physical examination findings, and laboratory test results.
* Treatment goals: Healthcare providers should clearly define the treatment goals and outcomes for each patient, and should consider the potential benefits and risks of OMT in relation to these goals.

Ultimately, the decision to combine OMT with conventional medical therapies for patients with chronic pain should be based on a careful consideration of the potential benefits and risks, as well as the individual needs and preferences of each patient.","['https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK553030/', 'https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-023-03076-2', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3068720/', 'https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/pmtf-final-report-2019-05-23.pdf', 'https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/complementary-alternative-or-integrative-health-whats-in-a-name', 'https://jom.osteopathic.org/', 'https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/318490', 'https://www.uhcprovider.com/content/dam/provider/docs/public/policies/medicaid-comm-plan/manipulative-therapy-cs.pdf', 'https://www.aetna.com/cpb/medical/data/300_399/0388.html', 'https://now.aapmr.org/alternative-and-complementary-approaches/', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9635890/', 'https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/osteopathic-manipulative-therapy', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7854390/', 'https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/complementary-alternative-or-integrative-health-whats-in-a-name', 'https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/21514-pain-management', 'https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/pmtf-final-report-2019-05-23.pdf', 'https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-023-03076-2', 'https://www.bmj.com/content/364/bmj.l689', 'https://www.uhcprovider.com/content/dam/provider/docs/public/policies/comm-medical-drug/manipulative-therapy.pdf', 'https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2777527', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9635890/', 'https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/osteopathic-manipulative-therapy', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7854390/', 'https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/complementary-alternative-or-integrative-health-whats-in-a-name', 'https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/21514-pain-management', 'https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/pmtf-final-report-2019-05-23.pdf', 'https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-023-03076-2', 'https://www.bmj.com/content/364/bmj.l689', 'https://www.uhcprovider.com/content/dam/provider/docs/public/policies/comm-medical-drug/manipulative-therapy.pdf', 'https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2777527']",medical and clinical knowledge
"Healthcare decision making comes down to risks vs. results.
There are many treatment options available today for just about any disease, disorder, malady or condition. The number of treatment options can sometimes be overwhelming. Finding a treatment option isn’t a problem, but finding the best treatment option is.
In an ideal world, there would be treatments that would work 100% of the time with absolutely no side effects.
In the real world, no treatment has a 100% success rate with many treatments having significant side effects. The bottom line is that since there are no guarantees, every treatment option is somewhat of a gamble.
People are running scared and looking at their choices now more than ever.
Medical error is now actually the 3rd leading cause of death in America. One source for this statistic is National Public Radio.
Treatment Options Fall Within Two Major Categories
The Traditional Western or Allopathic Medicine Options
- Over the counter or prescription drugs, which can have mild to serious and potentially deadly side effects. Prescription drug deaths total over 100,000/year.
- Surgery – The Lancet claims that the overall death rate for the two months following surgery is a staggering 1 in 28!
- Radiation – In the future, radiation treatment might be looked on in disbelief. The attempt of radiation is to try to kill the cancer before the healthy cells. (from WebMD)
- Psychiatry – Beware selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, which are antidepressants that have the potential side effects of suicide and homicide. This has been a hot topic of debate in recent years.
- Physical Therapy can be based on traditional medical principles or be more holistically oriented.
- Dentistry can also be based on more traditional or holistic approaches. Biological or holistic dentists have a more natural approach and don’t use amalgam fillings that are made of mercury and silver.
The Alternative, Holistic & Natural Healing Options
- Supplements, including; herbs, vitamins, minerals, probiotics, nutraceuticals and essential oils. I practice Science Based Nutrition, which uses supplements, food and lifestyle modifications rather than drugs to help the body to heal itself.
- Food Therapy – Utilizing healing foods. Here are 52 healing foods from Prevention Magazine.
- Exercise is Medicine – Exercise is therapeutic on many levels. Endurance, resistance training and flexibility training are 3 major categories. Exercise increases life expectancy and reduces stress. Exercise also reduces the odds of getting sick or injured and can be done at zero cost. Take a look at the Exercise is Medicine website.
- Chiropractic – This a method of healing that started in America in 1895. There are many systems of chiropractic, but the one that I prefer is Koren Specific Technique (KST).
- Osteopathy – This is another American method of healing that started in 1874. Please note that some osteopaths don’t do any manipulations any longer and are basically medical doctors. Here is some information about Osteopathy.
- Acupuncture – This is a Chinese method of healing that started well over 2,000 years ago. Very little was known about acupuncture in the United States before the 1960s. Here is a good source for more information about Acupuncture.

"competency and racial, gender, and ethnic disparities. As a result, there is a need for cultural competence, which is seen as a key component for reducing these disparities. Cultural competence in health refers to an organization's ability to provide effective healthcare services that meet a patient's social, cultural, and linguistic needs. Through cultural competence, stakeholders can consider the diversity of patients when planning, implementing, and evaluating health education and promotion programs and interventions. The Purnell Model for Cultural Competence is a broadly utilized framework to develop cultural competence in healthcare settings.
In this guide, our nursing writers will explore the Purnell model of cultural competence and explain how it applies in the medical setting.
The Purnell Model
The Purnell model for cultural competence was developed by Larry D. Purnell and Betty J. Paulanka in 1995 as a tool to encourage the importance of cultural awareness.
It proposes that healthcare workers are bound to encounter patients with diverse backgrounds in their day-to-day life in clinical settings. Thus, they should understand these diverse backgrounds and learn how to maneuver and overcome any challenges faced to ensure they deliver quality care to all.
Purnell's model provides a basis for healthcare workers to understand concepts and features such as language, values, beliefs, and customs relating to different cultures as a way to promote culturally competent healthcare.
Purnell's model consists of four circles of varying sizes, each representing all the meta paradigms applied to nursing, and the inner circle consists of 12 cultural domains. The following is an illustration of the model.
The meta paradigms are ideas that relate to nursing and other healthcare aspects that are critical in providing individual care to patients.
- The global society- represented by the outermost rim, relates to seeing the world as an interconnected entity consisting of people from various ethnic and cultural backgrounds. Various concepts, such as globalization and the rapid changes in technology, influence the global society.
- Community (the second rim) – Healthcare workers must consider a person’s position and sense of community in the provision of culturally competent care. By considering a person's sense of community, nurses and other healthcare workers can acknowledge that communities have different values, beliefs, and ethics.
- Family (third rim)- Caregivers must consider a person’s relationship with their family. Patients determine to what degree they want their family members to be involved in their care. Thus, caregivers must consider who their patients consider family to deliver culturally competent care.
- Person (fourth rim)- healthcare workers must consider an individual to deliver culturally competent care. This is because each individual has their own distinct way of seeing the world. In other words, each person is guided by their own values, beliefs, and ideas. Thus, caregivers must consider all of these when caring for individuals.
The innermost part of the circle is subdivided into wedges, each depicting the 12 cultural domains and their concepts, which provide the organizational framework of the model. The darker part of the circle depicts an unknown phenomenon. The jagged line along the bottom represents the nonlinear concept of cultural consciousness.
The 12 Cultural Domains
These cultural domains consist of concepts that must be considered when evaluating patients. These should not be viewed as separate entities, but one should recognize that they can influence each other; thus, one must view them as a unified whole. The 12 domains are essential for assessing the cultural aspects of an individual, family, or group include:
- Overview, inhabited localities, and topography- This refers to a person's origin and is crucial in helping healthcare workers understand themselves and their patients. The following are questions that a nurse can ask during assessment:
- Where do you currently live?
- What is your ancestry?
- What’s your birth location?
- How many years have you been living in this country (or their country of origin)?
- What brought you to this country (the current country they are in)
- What was the land like when you lived there?
- Have you been to other places/ countries?
- What’s your income level?
- Can your income level help you afford insurance?
- What’s your education level?
- What’s your current occupation?
- Communication- Refers to an individual's ability to express themselves and provide verbal and nonverbal cues. Furthermore, it deals with the interactions has been exposed to throughout their life with those close to them, such as family, friends, etc. Some of the questions that can be asked at this point include:
- What are your legal names?
- Which name do you prefer to be called?
- What’s your primary language?
- Do you speak other languages? If yes, which ones?","A patient from a non-English speaking country is hospitalized with a life-threatening condition. The patient's family members are present, but they are not fluent in the hospital's primary language. What communication strategy would you employ to ensure effective communication with the patient and their family, considering the patient's cultural background and communication style?","To ensure effective communication with the patient and their family, considering the patient's cultural background and communication style, I would employ the following strategies:

1. Identify the language gap and build trust: This can be done by introducing yourself and providing a brief report on the work needed and a brief patient history.
2. Use a professional interpreter: A professional interpreter can convey medical information accurately and help to build trust with the patient and their family.
3. Use non-verbal communication: Non-verbal communication, such as gestures and pointing, can be an effective way to communicate with patients who do not speak the same language.
4. Keep sentences short and simple: This can help to avoid confusion and ensure that the patient and their family understand the information being communicated.
5. Maintain appropriate eye contact: Eye contact is an important aspect of communication and can help to build trust and understanding.
6. Speak slowly and clearly: Speaking slowly and clearly can help to ensure that the patient and their family understand the information being communicated.
7. Use visual aids: Visual aids, such as pictures and diagrams, can be an effective way to communicate complex information to patients who do not speak the same language.
8. Learn basic phrases in the patient's language: Learning basic phrases in the patient's language can help to build trust and show respect for their culture.
9. Use technology: Technology, such as translation apps and video conferencing, can be an effective way to communicate with patients who do not speak the same language.
10. Involve the patient's family: Involving the patient's family in the communication process can help to ensure that they understand the information being communicated and can provide support to the patient.

By employing these strategies, healthcare providers can ensure effective communication with patients who do not speak the same language, which can help to improve patient outcomes and reduce the risk of miscommunication.","['https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8697718/', 'https://www.dtstranslates.com/language-service-provider-lsp/7-simple-tips-for-effectively-communicating-with-non-english-speaking-patients/', 'https://rnnetwork.com/blog/tips-for-talking-to-patients-who-dont-speak-english/', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5381929/', 'https://www.aacn.org/blog/caring-for-patients-with-non-english-language-preferences', 'https://www.goodrx.com/hcp-articles/providers/communicating-non-english-speaking-patients', 'https://www.ahrq.gov/health-literacy/improve/precautions/tool9.html', 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12070380/', 'https://psnet.ahrq.gov/web-mm/when-patients-and-providers-speak-different-languages', 'https://www.health.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0022/159601/5mcsr_communication.pdf', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8697718/', 'https://www.dtstranslates.com/language-service-provider-lsp/7-simple-tips-for-effectively-communicating-with-non-english-speaking-patients/', 'https://rnnetwork.com/blog/tips-for-talking-to-patients-who-dont-speak-english/', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5381929/', 'https://www.aacn.org/blog/caring-for-patients-with-non-english-language-preferences', 'https://www.goodrx.com/hcp-articles/providers/communicating-non-english-speaking-patients', 'https://www.ahrq.gov/health-literacy/improve/precautions/tool9.html', 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12070380/', 'https://psnet.ahrq.gov/web-mm/when-patients-and-providers-speak-different-languages', 'https://www.health.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0022/159601/5mcsr_communication.pdf', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8697718/', 'https://www.dtstranslates.com/language-service-provider-lsp/7-simple-tips-for-effectively-communicating-with-non-english-speaking-patients/', 'https://rnnetwork.com/blog/tips-for-talking-to-patients-who-dont-speak-english/', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5381929/', 'https://www.aacn.org/blog/caring-for-patients-with-non-english-language-preferences', 'https://www.goodrx.com/hcp-articles/providers/communicating-non-english-speaking-patients', 'https://www.ahrq.gov/health-literacy/improve/precautions/tool9.html', 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12070380/', 'https://psnet.ahrq.gov/web-mm/when-patients-and-providers-speak-different-languages', 'https://www.health.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0022/159601/5mcsr_communication.pdf']",medical and clinical knowledge
"competency and racial, gender, and ethnic disparities. As a result, there is a need for cultural competence, which is seen as a key component for reducing these disparities. Cultural competence in health refers to an organization's ability to provide effective healthcare services that meet a patient's social, cultural, and linguistic needs. Through cultural competence, stakeholders can consider the diversity of patients when planning, implementing, and evaluating health education and promotion programs and interventions. The Purnell Model for Cultural Competence is a broadly utilized framework to develop cultural competence in healthcare settings.
In this guide, our nursing writers will explore the Purnell model of cultural competence and explain how it applies in the medical setting.
The Purnell Model
The Purnell model for cultural competence was developed by Larry D. Purnell and Betty J. Paulanka in 1995 as a tool to encourage the importance of cultural awareness.
It proposes that healthcare workers are bound to encounter patients with diverse backgrounds in their day-to-day life in clinical settings. Thus, they should understand these diverse backgrounds and learn how to maneuver and overcome any challenges faced to ensure they deliver quality care to all.
Purnell's model provides a basis for healthcare workers to understand concepts and features such as language, values, beliefs, and customs relating to different cultures as a way to promote culturally competent healthcare.
Purnell's model consists of four circles of varying sizes, each representing all the meta paradigms applied to nursing, and the inner circle consists of 12 cultural domains. The following is an illustration of the model.
The meta paradigms are ideas that relate to nursing and other healthcare aspects that are critical in providing individual care to patients.
- The global society- represented by the outermost rim, relates to seeing the world as an interconnected entity consisting of people from various ethnic and cultural backgrounds. Various concepts, such as globalization and the rapid changes in technology, influence the global society.
- Community (the second rim) – Healthcare workers must consider a person’s position and sense of community in the provision of culturally competent care. By considering a person's sense of community, nurses and other healthcare workers can acknowledge that communities have different values, beliefs, and ethics.
- Family (third rim)- Caregivers must consider a person’s relationship with their family. Patients determine to what degree they want their family members to be involved in their care. Thus, caregivers must consider who their patients consider family to deliver culturally competent care.
- Person (fourth rim)- healthcare workers must consider an individual to deliver culturally competent care. This is because each individual has their own distinct way of seeing the world. In other words, each person is guided by their own values, beliefs, and ideas. Thus, caregivers must consider all of these when caring for individuals.
The innermost part of the circle is subdivided into wedges, each depicting the 12 cultural domains and their concepts, which provide the organizational framework of the model. The darker part of the circle depicts an unknown phenomenon. The jagged line along the bottom represents the nonlinear concept of cultural consciousness.
The 12 Cultural Domains
These cultural domains consist of concepts that must be considered when evaluating patients. These should not be viewed as separate entities, but one should recognize that they can influence each other; thus, one must view them as a unified whole. The 12 domains are essential for assessing the cultural aspects of an individual, family, or group include:
- Overview, inhabited localities, and topography- This refers to a person's origin and is crucial in helping healthcare workers understand themselves and their patients. The following are questions that a nurse can ask during assessment:
- Where do you currently live?
- What is your ancestry?
- What’s your birth location?
- How many years have you been living in this country (or their country of origin)?
- What brought you to this country (the current country they are in)
- What was the land like when you lived there?
- Have you been to other places/ countries?
- What’s your income level?
- Can your income level help you afford insurance?
- What’s your education level?
- What’s your current occupation?
- Communication- Refers to an individual's ability to express themselves and provide verbal and nonverbal cues. Furthermore, it deals with the interactions has been exposed to throughout their life with those close to them, such as family, friends, etc. Some of the questions that can be asked at this point include:
- What are your legal names?
- Which name do you prefer to be called?
- What’s your primary language?
- Do you speak other languages? If yes, which ones?",What are some potential challenges that a healthcare provider might face when trying to establish trust with a patient who has a strong spiritual belief system and is hesitant to share their beliefs with the provider?,"The potential challenges that a healthcare provider might face when trying to establish trust with a patient who has a strong spiritual belief system and is hesitant to share their beliefs with the provider include:

1. Difficulty in understanding the patient's spiritual beliefs and how they influence their medical decisions.
2. Fear of proselytizing or ridiculing the patient's beliefs, which can lead to a breakdown in trust.
3. Inadequate training or experience in addressing spiritual issues in patient care.
4. Limited knowledge of the patient's cultural and religious background, which can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunication.
5. The patient's fear of being judged or stigmatized due to their spiritual beliefs.
6. The healthcare provider's own personal beliefs or biases, which can influence their approach to patient care.
7. The challenge of balancing the patient's spiritual needs with their medical needs.
8. The need to establish a patient-centered approach to spiritual care, rather than a provider-centered approach.

To overcome these challenges, healthcare providers can take the following steps:

1. Educate themselves on the patient's spiritual beliefs and how they influence their medical decisions.
2. Use open-ended questions to encourage the patient to share their spiritual beliefs and concerns.
3. Avoid making assumptions or judgments about the patient's beliefs.
4. Focus on building a patient-centered approach to spiritual care, rather than a provider-centered approach.
5. Be aware of their own personal beliefs and biases, and strive to be neutral and non-judgmental.
6. Establish a trusting relationship with the patient by being empathetic, respectful, and compassionate.
7. Be willing to seek guidance from spiritual leaders or other healthcare providers if needed.
8. Continuously evaluate and improve their approach to spiritual care to ensure that it is patient-centered and effective.","['https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3641707/', 'https://www.ramseysolutions.com/personal-growth/faith-during-financial-crisis', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK493216/', 'https://ctb.ku.edu/en/table-of-contents/culture/cultural-competence/building-relationships/main', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1305900/', 'https://www.nami.org/Blogs/NAMI-Blog/July-2020/My-Faith-Saved-Me', 'https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/09/us-culture-moral-education-formation/674765/', 'https://www.socialworktoday.com/archive/0720p20.shtml', 'https://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/apost_exhortations/documents/papa-francesco_esortazione-ap_20131124_evangelii-gaudium.html', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/18/health/resilience-relationships-trauma.html', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3641707/', 'https://www.ramseysolutions.com/personal-growth/faith-during-financial-crisis', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK493216/', 'https://ctb.ku.edu/en/table-of-contents/culture/cultural-competence/building-relationships/main', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1305900/', 'https://www.nami.org/Blogs/NAMI-Blog/July-2020/My-Faith-Saved-Me', 'https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/09/us-culture-moral-education-formation/674765/', 'https://www.socialworktoday.com/archive/0720p20.shtml', 'https://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/apost_exhortations/documents/papa-francesco_esortazione-ap_20131124_evangelii-gaudium.html', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/18/health/resilience-relationships-trauma.html', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3641707/', 'https://www.ramseysolutions.com/personal-growth/faith-during-financial-crisis', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK493216/', 'https://ctb.ku.edu/en/table-of-contents/culture/cultural-competence/building-relationships/main', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1305900/', 'https://www.nami.org/Blogs/NAMI-Blog/July-2020/My-Faith-Saved-Me', 'https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/09/us-culture-moral-education-formation/674765/', 'https://www.socialworktoday.com/archive/0720p20.shtml', 'https://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/apost_exhortations/documents/papa-francesco_esortazione-ap_20131124_evangelii-gaudium.html', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/18/health/resilience-relationships-trauma.html']",medical and clinical knowledge

"Clinical Pharmacists are an integral member of your care team.
Behind every successful medical story is a Clinical Pharmacist working alongside your Primary Care physician or specialist. For many people, a pharmacist is that person in the white coat behind the counter at the drugstore, counting pills. Dispensing medications is a role pharmacists may perform, but the scope of their contribution to a patient’s healthcare goes much farther.
When did Pharmacy become a profession?
Before we dig into defining Clinical Pharmacy, we should take a brief history lesson. Did you know that as far back as 1,500 BC, during the reign of the ancient Egyptians. Paleontologists specializing in Paleopharmacology discovered sheets of papyrus (more than 1,000 sheets!) that cataloged hundreds of recipes for medications derived from plants. Throughout the centuries, Apothecaries and Chemists (as they were once called) worked beside healers and priests to care for the sick. Chemists’ roles were instrumental in the treatment of afflicted individuals.
Fast forward to the late 1,800s and early 1,900s to the industrial revolution. The increased technical sophistication opened the doors to developing processes to purify natural materials and began synthesizing organic chemicals. Insulin and Penicillin were also discovered.
Today there are countless types of pharmacists found in drug manufacturing and research, and in direct patient care. Additionally, pharmacists can specialize in 13 of board certified specialty fields like:
- Ambulatory care
- Compounded sterile preparations
- Critical care
- Infectious diseases
- Nutrition support
- And Solid organ transplant

Did you know that some medications work best at different times of the day? For instance atorvastatin (cholesterol medication) works best in the evening when the cholesterol-making enzymes in your body are more active. Your Clinical Pharmacist works with you and your doctors to maximize the effectiveness of your prescription drugs.
One of the benefits of using our Clinical Pharmacists is knowing you are taking the best option for your particular case. Our pharmacists make it a point to be up-to-date on the newest drugs and understand their interactions. In addition, they can recommend alternative medication treatment paths if you are not getting the results you and your doctor expect.
You may be a person with more than one health issue that requires medications. Taking multiple medications can pose certain risks if the medications don’t interact well with one another. Our Clinical Pharmacists understand medication interactions and can help you avoid adverse medication interactions. They may also be able to help consolidate the number of medications you take by finding drugs that may treat multiple conditions.
Ensuring cost savings
Medications are expensive. Even with insurance, some patients’ medications make up a big portion of their monthly expenses. Think Clinical Pharmacists will work with your doctor, insurance company and retail pharmacy, to get the lowest prices for your medications. Oftentimes, it may be prescribing a different brand medication or taking three 100mg pills vs. one 300mg pill.
Some patients need more support than others. Patients with uncontrolled Diabetes, or have multiple health conditions may need frequent contact with a healthcare professional. Our Clinical Pharmacists work directly with your physician to ensure continuity of care and can provide recommendations on medication adjustments. In the case of uncontrolled Diabetes, a patient may have a team of healthcare professionals helping the patient stabilize their blood sugar levels. This team may include Physicians, Clinical Pharmacists and Pharmacy Technicians, Care Coordinators, Diabetic Educators and Dietitians, and Social Workers.

"Clinical Pharmacists are an integral member of your care team.
Behind every successful medical story is a Clinical Pharmacist working alongside your Primary Care physician or specialist. For many people, a pharmacist is that person in the white coat behind the counter at the drugstore, counting pills. Dispensing medications is a role pharmacists may perform, but the scope of their contribution to a patient’s healthcare goes much farther.
When did Pharmacy become a profession?
Before we dig into defining Clinical Pharmacy, we should take a brief history lesson. Did you know that as far back as 1,500 BC, during the reign of the ancient Egyptians. Paleontologists specializing in Paleopharmacology discovered sheets of papyrus (more than 1,000 sheets!) that cataloged hundreds of recipes for medications derived from plants. Throughout the centuries, Apothecaries and Chemists (as they were once called) worked beside healers and priests to care for the sick. Chemists’ roles were instrumental in the treatment of afflicted individuals.
Fast forward to the late 1,800s and early 1,900s to the industrial revolution. The increased technical sophistication opened the doors to developing processes to purify natural materials and began synthesizing organic chemicals. Insulin and Penicillin were also discovered.
Today there are countless types of pharmacists found in drug manufacturing and research, and in direct patient care. Additionally, pharmacists can specialize in 13 of board certified specialty fields like:
- Ambulatory care
- Compounded sterile preparations
- Critical care
- Infectious diseases
- Nutrition support
- And Solid organ transplant

"Healthcare providers are required to obtain informed consent from their patients before any procedures or treatments are carried out.
This involves informing your patient about the risks and benefits of the treatment, as well as giving them the opportunity to ask any questions they might have.
Informed consent is a legal requirement in many countries, and it’s important that healthcare providers follow all the guidelines set out by law when carrying out this process.
What is Informed Consent?
Informed consent as a healthcare provider is a process of obtaining permission to provide medical treatment or procedures from a patient. It is a vital part of ethical healthcare, and it is important to ensure that patients understand what care they are consenting to.
Informed consent must be given before any treatment can begin, and it should be repeated as needed throughout the course of care. Patients must be able to understand the risks and benefits of any proposed treatment, as well as their right to refuse or withdraw consent at any time. Healthcare providers must always take into account the patient’s wishes and concerns, and ensure that all information is accurately conveyed.
How is Informed Consent Obtained?
When providing healthcare services, it is important to ensure that patients have the opportunity to provide informed consent. Informed consent is a process whereby patients are given information about the potential risks and benefits of a proposed treatment and are allowed to make decisions about whether or not they want to participate in the study or treatment.
Informed consent can be achieved through a variety of different methods, including verbal communication, written communication, and electronic communication. It is important to note that informed consent must be obtained from each patient before any treatment can begin. Patients can refuse treatment at any time, and their refusal cannot be used against them in court.
How to Obtain Informed Consent from Patients?
Informed consent is a cornerstone of ethical medical practice. It ensures that patients understand the risks and benefits of any treatment or procedure they are considering and that they have given their consent to proceed. To obtain informed consent from patients, healthcare providers must first ensure that they understand the basics of informed consent.
First and foremost, any treatment or procedure involves potential risks and benefits. Healthcare providers must ensure that patients fully understand both before agreeing to undergo any treatment or procedure. Patients should be aware of the possible risks and benefits associated with any given treatment before making a decision so that they can make an informed choice.
Second, healthcare providers must also ensure that patients have the necessary information to give informed consent. This includes understanding their legal rights and responsibilities as well as what information is necessary to make an informed decision. Healthcare providers must also provide patients with clear and concise explanations of any risks and benefits involved in any given treatment or procedure.
Finally, healthcare providers must always follow up with patients after they have given informed consent to ensure that they are still comfortable with their decision. If at any time patients feel unable to give consent or want additional information, healthcare providers should provide it without delay.
As a healthcare provider, it is important that you understand and comply with the requirements of informed consent statutes in your state. By understanding these requirements, you can help ensure that your patients have the best possible experience while receiving medical care. Informed consent is a key part of providing quality care and protecting both patients and providers from harmful lawsuits.","Can a healthcare provider who has a personal stake in a patient's treatment decision still obtain valid informed consent from the patient, and if so, what safeguards would be necessary to ensure the patient's rights are protected?","The safeguards necessary to ensure patient rights are protected when a healthcare provider has a personal stake in a patient's treatment decision include:

1. Disclosure: The healthcare provider must disclose their personal stake in the patient's treatment decision to the patient and obtain their informed consent.
2. Independent Review: The patient's treatment decision should be reviewed by an independent healthcare provider to ensure that the decision is in the patient's best interest.
3. Patient Advocacy: Patients should have access to patient advocacy services to ensure that their rights are protected and their interests are represented.
4. Transparency: Healthcare providers must be transparent about their personal stake in the patient's treatment decision and provide clear information about the potential benefits and risks of the treatment.
5. Conflict of Interest: Healthcare providers with a personal stake in the patient's treatment decision should be required to disclose their conflict of interest and recuse themselves from making treatment decisions.
6. Patient Education: Patients should be educated about their rights and the potential risks and benefits of the treatment, and should be empowered to make informed decisions about their care.
7. Independent Oversight: Healthcare providers should be subject to independent oversight and monitoring to ensure that they are providing high-quality care and respecting patient rights.

These safeguards can help to ensure that patients receive high-quality care and that their rights are protected, even when a healthcare provider has a personal stake in their treatment decision.","['https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430827/', 'https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/guidance/faq/informed-consent/index.html', 'https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?Cite=7.70.065', 'https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/hipaa-privacy-rule-and-sharing-info-related-to-mental-health.pdf', 'https://www.nj.gov/health/advancedirective/ad/forums-faqs/', 'https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodefull/title54.1/chapter29/article8/', 'https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/advance-care-planning/advance-care-planning-advance-directives-health-care', 'https://code-medical-ethics.ama-assn.org/ethics-opinions/informed-consent', 'https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/informed-consent-what-must-physician-disclose-patient/2012-07', 'https://www.health.ny.gov/professionals/patients/patient_rights/molst/frequently_asked_questions.htm', 'https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/guidance/access/index.html', 'https://www.eu-patient.eu/globalassets/policy/data-protection/data-protection-guide-for-patients-organisations.pdf', 'https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-individuals/guidance-materials-for-consumers/index.html', 'https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=70.02&full=true', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK519540/', 'https://code-medical-ethics.ama-assn.org/ethics-opinions/informed-consent', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/03/07/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-continues-the-fight-for-reproductive-freedom/', 'https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-mechanisms/instruments/principles-protection-persons-mental-illness-and-improvement', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/07/08/fact-sheet-president-biden-to-sign-executive-order-protecting-access-to-reproductive-health-care-services/', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK236546/', 'https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/guidance/access/index.html', 'https://www.eu-patient.eu/globalassets/policy/data-protection/data-protection-guide-for-patients-organisations.pdf', 'https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-individuals/guidance-materials-for-consumers/index.html', 'https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=70.02&full=true', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK519540/', 'https://code-medical-ethics.ama-assn.org/ethics-opinions/informed-consent', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/03/07/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-continues-the-fight-for-reproductive-freedom/', 'https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-mechanisms/instruments/principles-protection-persons-mental-illness-and-improvement', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/07/08/fact-sheet-president-biden-to-sign-executive-order-protecting-access-to-reproductive-health-care-services/', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK236546/']",medical and clinical knowledge
"Education Required To Be A Doctor – A chemistry degree alone will not allow you to become a doctor in the UK, it will help you get into medical school. Many subjects related to medicine focus on or are related to chemistry. If you have a degree in chemistry, you already have a good foundation and proven ability in science and math.
A chemistry degree is enough to get a job in the medical field or a related industry. For example, you may choose to work as a medical research laboratory technician in a hospital or as a drug designer in a pharmaceutical company. However, calling yourself a doctor is not enough. If this is your decision, you should go to medical school.
Education Required To Be A Doctor
In the UK, medical schools have certain entry requirements. You can get admission as an undergraduate or graduate student. If you already have a degree in chemistry, you can apply as a graduate student. Few of your core subjects are covered in chemistry so it shortens your course significantly.
What Your Doctor Really Listens For With A Stethoscope
Depending on the medical school, you may also have to take an admissions test and an interview. After you pass the entry requirements, you must follow the curriculum and complete all the requirements. It will take about five years. After you graduate, you must take the medical licensing exam to become a general practitioner.
After obtaining your medical license, you must complete two years of basic training as a general practitioner in a clinical setting, such as a hospital or clinic, where you can practice what you have learned.
A Core Medical Training (CMT) or Comprehensive Care Nursing (ACCS) training program takes another two or three years to complete. This is the first step of your special training. Then you can focus on a specific area one by one. It takes four to seven years of systematic training and practice (residence) before you become an expert.
So you need up to 15 years of formal education, training and clinical practice before becoming a medical professional. Even after this, you will need to attend regular meetings, training and online courses every year to earn Continuing Professional Development (CPD) points. CPD is essential to ensure you stay up to date with the latest developments in medicine.

Understanding biochemical pathways is important in diagnosing and treating certain diseases, especially those with genetic and hormonal causes. Basically, medicine is about repairing damaged biochemical processes. These include immune-related diseases and metabolic diseases.
In the strict sense, a scientist is a highly specialized expert who conducts studies, academic research and practical studies on a specific topic in a specific field of natural science. A scientist collects large amounts of data and evidence, formulates hypotheses, and tests these hypotheses to gain a better understanding of the natural world.
Professional scientists are often connected to a university and they publish their research in peer-reviewed journals. They are also members of scientific societies in their own scientific fields.
What Is A Dermatologist?
Most medical doctors practice their work in medical care facilities such as hospitals, clinics and assisted living homes. Their work is less susceptible to scientific research.
However, medical doctors can also be scientists in a broader sense because they use the scientific method in their diagnoses and daily work. Some medical doctors choose to focus on pure scientific research and academic studies, which makes them professional scientists rather than doctors.
Whether the Doctor of Science and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degrees have the same academic weight or qualifications depends on each authority and university. Both focus on academic research and are considered the highest level of an academic degree.
However, a PhD is more varied and may include non-science specialties such as music, literature, and history. An ScD, meanwhile, focuses more on natural sciences such as chemistry.
Entry Requirement (malaysian & International)
In England, you can get a PhD degree in any available field of study by writing a thesis and undertaking an oral defense of your research topic. A committee of reviewers often provides corrections and suggestions to further improve the research. You should normally have completed a master’s degree before applying for a PhD.
However, the ScD degree is awarded for accumulating published research after completing your academic degrees. In England, the ScD is a higher doctorate level than the PhD. In other countries, however, it is equivalent to a PhD in a scientific field of study.","What is the optimal balance between theoretical knowledge and practical experience in medical school training, and how does this balance impact a student's ability to diagnose and treat patients effectively?","The optimal balance between theoretical knowledge and practical experience in medical school training is a crucial aspect of preparing students to become competent physicians. The search results suggest that a balance between the two is essential, as it allows students to acquire the necessary skills and knowledge to diagnose and treat patients effectively. The perspectives on the optimal balance between theoretical knowledge and practical experience in medical school training vary, with some requiring less practice, some more, and past experiences and skills being a factor.

"Education Required To Be A Doctor – A chemistry degree alone will not allow you to become a doctor in the UK, it will help you get into medical school. Many subjects related to medicine focus on or are related to chemistry. If you have a degree in chemistry, you already have a good foundation and proven ability in science and math.
A chemistry degree is enough to get a job in the medical field or a related industry. For example, you may choose to work as a medical research laboratory technician in a hospital or as a drug designer in a pharmaceutical company. However, calling yourself a doctor is not enough. If this is your decision, you should go to medical school.
Education Required To Be A Doctor
In the UK, medical schools have certain entry requirements. You can get admission as an undergraduate or graduate student. If you already have a degree in chemistry, you can apply as a graduate student. Few of your core subjects are covered in chemistry so it shortens your course significantly.
What Your Doctor Really Listens For With A Stethoscope
Depending on the medical school, you may also have to take an admissions test and an interview. After you pass the entry requirements, you must follow the curriculum and complete all the requirements. It will take about five years. After you graduate, you must take the medical licensing exam to become a general practitioner.
After obtaining your medical license, you must complete two years of basic training as a general practitioner in a clinical setting, such as a hospital or clinic, where you can practice what you have learned.
A Core Medical Training (CMT) or Comprehensive Care Nursing (ACCS) training program takes another two or three years to complete. This is the first step of your special training. Then you can focus on a specific area one by one. It takes four to seven years of systematic training and practice (residence) before you become an expert.
So you need up to 15 years of formal education, training and clinical practice before becoming a medical professional. Even after this, you will need to attend regular meetings, training and online courses every year to earn Continuing Professional Development (CPD) points. CPD is essential to ensure you stay up to date with the latest developments in medicine.

1. The idea that a person's body can store electricity, which is not true. The human body does not store electricity, and it is safe to touch someone who has been struck by lightning.
2. The myth that eating sugar can make cancer worse. There is no scientific evidence to support this claim, and a healthy diet is important for overall health, regardless of a person's cancer diagnosis.
3. The misconception that the appendix is useless. While the appendix is not essential for survival, it can still cause problems if it becomes inflamed or infected.
4. The idea that big feet are a sign of a big body. There is no correlation between foot size and body size.
5. The myth that the body begins to use stored glucose and glycogen when it is not getting enough carbohydrates from food. While the body does store glucose and glycogen, it does not use these stores as a primary source of energy.
6. The misconception that the right to health is not a fundamental human right. The right to health is recognized as a fundamental human right by the World Health Organization and other international organizations.
7. The idea that the normal human body temperature is around 98.6°F (37°C). While this was once believed to be the normal body temperature, it is now known that the normal body temperature can vary depending on the individual and the environment.
8. The myth that common warts are caused by poor hygiene or poor personal habits. Common warts are caused by a virus, specifically the human papillomavirus (HPV).
9. The misconception that the body can grow new organs or tissues after death. While the body can undergo some changes after death, it is not capable of growing new organs or tissues.
10. The idea that the body can regenerate lost limbs or organs. While the body has some ability to regenerate certain tissues, it is not capable of regrowing entire limbs or organs.

"The Essential Role of Clinical Pathology
Clinical pathology plays an important role in healthcare. It involves the analysis of patient samples such as blood, urine, and other bodily fluids to detect abnormalities that might indicate disease. Clinical pathologists act as medical investigators, using laboratory tests to uncover clues about a patient’s health.
They work behind the scenes, using advanced technologies and methods to analyze samples, helping clinicians to make informed decisions about diagnosis and treatment. From an everyday health check-up to the management of chronic diseases, this type of pathology plays a crucial part in patient care.
Subspecialties in Clinical Pathology
Clinical chemistry is a subspecialty of clinical pathology that deals with the study of bodily fluids for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. It involves a range of tests, such as blood glucose testing, liver and kidney function tests, and electrolyte analysis, to assess the chemical status of the body. These tests help to diagnose and monitor diseases like diabetes, kidney disease, and liver disease.
Hematology, another subspecialty, is concerned with diseases related to blood and blood-forming organs. Hematologists analyze blood samples to diagnose conditions such as anemia, clotting disorders, leukemia, and lymphoma. A common procedure in hematology is the Complete Blood Count (CBC), which measures the number of different types of cells in a patient’s blood.
Clinical microbiology focuses on the identification of infectious agents, such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. This specialty plays a critical role in diagnosing and managing infectious diseases, including pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and sexually transmitted diseases.
Common Diseases Diagnosed Through Clinical Pathology
Pathology provides essential information for the diagnosis of numerous health conditions. These include common ailments like diabetes through blood glucose testing, kidney diseases through urine analysis, and bacterial or viral infections through microbiological tests. Additionally, it plays an essential role in diagnosing and monitoring cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and autoimmune diseases.
Clinical Pathology in the Era of Precision Medicine
Advancements in clinical pathology have paved the way for precision medicine – a medical approach that customizes patient care based on individual variability in genes, environment, and lifestyle. For instance, genetic testing, a part of molecular pathology, can identify patients at high risk of certain diseases, enabling preventative measures or early treatment.
Clinical Pathology and Patient Care
Though less visible to patients, clinical pathology plays a crucial role in medicine. By providing valuable diagnostic information, it guides physicians in diagnosing and treating many diseases. It is the backbone of modern medicine, enabling the shift towards a more personalized approach in patient care. The work of clinical pathologists assures that every patient’s unique health situation is fully understood, promoting better health outcomes.","What factors contribute to the development of antibiotic-resistant urinary tract infections, and how can clinicians effectively prevent the spread of these infections in a healthcare setting?","The factors contributing to the development of antibiotic-resistant urinary tract infections (UTIs) are multifaceted and complex, involving both anthropogenic and biological factors. Anthropogenic factors include overuse and misuse of antibiotics, incorrect diagnoses, and the lack of access to clean water and sanitation. Biological factors include the virulence of uropathogenic bacteria, such as Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp., and the development of antibiotic resistance in these bacteria.

To effectively prevent the spread of antibiotic-resistant UTIs in a healthcare setting, clinicians must consider multiple factors and implement evidence-based strategies. These strategies include:

1. Improving antibiotic stewardship by reducing the use of antibiotics and promoting the use of alternative treatments.
2. Implementing infection prevention and control measures, such as hand hygiene, contact precautions, and environmental cleaning and disinfection.
3. Enhancing surveillance and monitoring of UTIs and antibiotic resistance.
4. Promoting education and awareness among healthcare providers, patients, and the public about the importance of antibiotic stewardship and the risks of antibiotic resistance.
5. Encouraging the development and use of new antibiotics and diagnostic tests.
6. Implementing strategies to reduce the transmission of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens, such as pathogen reduction and contact precautions.
7. Encouraging the use of alternative treatments, such as probiotics and antiseptics, for UTIs.
8. Implementing strategies to reduce the use of antibiotics in agriculture and the environment.

By implementing these strategies, clinicians can help prevent the spread of antibiotic-resistant UTIs and reduce the risk of antibiotic resistance in healthcare settings.","['https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK436013/', 'https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/antimicrobial-resistance', 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37374909/', 'https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2607/11/6/1407', 'https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/21655-antibiotic-resistance', 'https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/79/2/295/7640789', 'https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/antibiotic-resistant-urinary-tract-infections-are-on-the-rise-2019101417982', 'https://www.nature.com/articles/nrmicro3432', 'https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)02724-0/fulltext', 'https://www.antibioticresearch.org.uk/patient-support/specific-infections/urinary-tract-infections-utis/', 'https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/antimicrobial-resistance', 'https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2607/11/6/1407', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10145414/', 'https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)02724-0/fulltext', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK97126/', 'https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6509e1.htm', 'https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/antibiotic-resistant-urinary-tract-infections-are-on-the-rise-2019101417982', 'https://www.cdc.gov/antimicrobial-resistance/data-research/threats/index.html', 'https://www.antibioticresearch.org.uk/patient-support/specific-infections/urinary-tract-infections-utis/', 'https://www.nature.com/articles/s41585-018-0106-x', 'https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/antimicrobial-resistance', 'https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6509e1.htm', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK559312/', 'https://www.cdc.gov/infection-control/hcp/mdro-management/prevention-control.html', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK2683/', 'https://www.jointcommission.org/resources/patient-safety-topics/infection-prevention-and-control/antibiotic-stewardship/', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK441857/', 'https://arpsp.cdc.gov/profile/geography/missouri', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK2632/', 'https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/30/6/23-1338_article']",medical and clinical knowledge

Assessment Tool, Diagnostics, Growth, Measurements, and Nutrition in Adults and Children – Week 3 (11m)
LACHANDA BROWN: Hello,
everyone and welcome to 6512: Advance Health Assessment. I’m Dr. LaChanda Brown, and I’m
one of the contributing faculty members in the Advance
Health Assessment course. In this week, week
3, we will focus on assessment tools, diagnostics
and growth, measurements, and nutrition, in
adults and children.
One of the major issues in
health care today is obesity. Obesity is an
ever-growing problem. It has increased the mortality
rate, morbidity, and increases in health care costs
as well as utilization. We have also seen an
increase in obesity in children over
the past 30 years. When we are looking
at all of this, we want to make sure that we
get an overall health overview.
We want to look at nutritional
status, as well as body measurements, as
well as other factors like socioeconomic,
culture, religion. There are several ways that
we can look at our patients as far as providing care. One such way is
cultural competency. As mentioned previously,
cultural competency is very important. We want to make sure that
we are culturally sensitive, being sensitive to the
needs of our patients, as well as being
aware of diversity.
We know that not
everyone is the same. We want to be aware of a
patient’s religion, how it may affect their
health care, as well as socioeconomic status, as
well as any other thing that can affect the patient’s care. We want to be sensitive
to that, and we want to assess the
needs of that patient. By being culturally
competent, we can help to define
the culture broadly. We can look at a client’s
Again, how does that
affect their patient care? How does that affect how
they take care of themselves, if they’re taking
their medication, how they interact with you? We also want to
recognize the complexity in language and interpretation. We also want to facilitate
learning between providers and communities. So you may be in
a community that may be poor socioeconomic or
possible language barriers.
You want to try
to figure out ways to be able to interact
with your patients. And you also want to
be able to collaborate with other agencies, if
possible, for your patient. And also provide
training, making sure that you have that you are
trained in cultural sensitivity and diversity, as well as staff. So when we look at assessment
tools with our patients, we want to make
sure that we have tools that will accurately
test the patients and assess their needs.
For example, if a patient comes
in with issues of sore throat, most likely, you will
do a rapid strep test. But you also want to
make sure that you are aware that that strep
test may be invalid. You want to look at the
patient’s overall symptoms. Another example is
looking at BMIs. You want to look at
the BMI of a patient. A patient’s BMI may be higher. You may have one ethnicity
that may have a higher BMI, but not necessarily
be obese by looking. But if you calculate
the height and weight, it will automatically
But by looking at the patient,
they may not look obese. So you want to be aware
of your assessment tools. You want to look
at your reliability and validity of your tools. And then you want to
look at diagnostic costs. We never want to order
tests that are unnecessary, but we also want to
order tests that will be effective for the patient.
So being aware of that, one of
the main issues that we have seen in health care [AUDIO OUT] One of the issues that
we look at is treatment. Is it effective? When we order tests,
will it make a difference in the morbidity or
mortality of the condition, if it’s caught early or
if it’s detected late. So you want to be aware of that. Another issue is
that more than 50% of orders that
have been made will be a big eye-opener to
policyholders to your patient. They may not know why
this test is ordered. So you want to make
sure that you explain the tests that you’re
ordering and why, and making sure that the
patient is aware of it, and that they’re OK with
the diagnostic test.
So this week, you will
have a case study, and you will use week 3. You will apply, from
your reading material, diagnostic tools,
growth, and measurements. Your case study will be posted
by day 1 by your instructor. Your next assignment
is your Shadow Health. I’ve been discussing
Shadow Health since week 1, but this is the first week
that your orientation is due. Please remember, if you haven’t

Assessment Tool, Diagnostics, Growth, Measurements, and Nutrition in Adults and Children – Week 3 (11m)
LACHANDA BROWN: Hello,
everyone and welcome to 6512: Advance Health Assessment. I’m Dr. LaChanda Brown, and I’m
one of the contributing faculty members in the Advance
Health Assessment course. In this week, week
3, we will focus on assessment tools, diagnostics
and growth, measurements, and nutrition, in
adults and children.
One of the major issues in
health care today is obesity. Obesity is an
ever-growing problem. It has increased the mortality
rate, morbidity, and increases in health care costs
as well as utilization. We have also seen an
increase in obesity in children over
the past 30 years. When we are looking
at all of this, we want to make sure that we
get an overall health overview.
We want to look at nutritional
status, as well as body measurements, as
well as other factors like socioeconomic,
culture, religion. There are several ways that
we can look at our patients as far as providing care. One such way is
cultural competency. As mentioned previously,
cultural competency is very important. We want to make sure that
we are culturally sensitive, being sensitive to the
needs of our patients, as well as being
aware of diversity.
We know that not
everyone is the same. We want to be aware of a
patient’s religion, how it may affect their
health care, as well as socioeconomic status, as
well as any other thing that can affect the patient’s care. We want to be sensitive
to that, and we want to assess the
needs of that patient. By being culturally
competent, we can help to define
the culture broadly. We can look at a client’s
Again, how does that
affect their patient care? How does that affect how
they take care of themselves, if they’re taking
their medication, how they interact with you? We also want to
recognize the complexity in language and interpretation. We also want to facilitate
learning between providers and communities. So you may be in
a community that may be poor socioeconomic or
possible language barriers.
You want to try
to figure out ways to be able to interact
with your patients. And you also want to
be able to collaborate with other agencies, if
possible, for your patient. And also provide
training, making sure that you have that you are
trained in cultural sensitivity and diversity, as well as staff. So when we look at assessment
tools with our patients, we want to make
sure that we have tools that will accurately
test the patients and assess their needs.
For example, if a patient comes
in with issues of sore throat, most likely, you will
do a rapid strep test. But you also want to
make sure that you are aware that that strep
test may be invalid. You want to look at the
patient’s overall symptoms. Another example is
looking at BMIs. You want to look at
the BMI of a patient. A patient’s BMI may be higher. You may have one ethnicity
that may have a higher BMI, but not necessarily
be obese by looking. But if you calculate
the height and weight, it will automatically
But by looking at the patient,
they may not look obese. So you want to be aware
of your assessment tools. You want to look
at your reliability and validity of your tools. And then you want to
look at diagnostic costs. We never want to order
tests that are unnecessary, but we also want to
order tests that will be effective for the patient.

Individuals with lower SES often face barriers to healthcare access, health literacy, and social support, which can negatively impact their health outcomes. Healthcare providers can address this issue by using strategies such as:

1. Providing culturally sensitive care: Healthcare providers should be aware of the cultural differences and nuances that may affect patients' understanding and adherence to treatment plans.
2. Improving health literacy: Healthcare providers should use clear and simple language to explain treatment plans and provide patients with educational materials that are easy to understand.
3. Addressing social determinants of health: Healthcare providers should consider the social determinants of health, such as housing, employment, and education, when developing treatment plans for patients with chronic diseases.
4. Building trust: Healthcare providers should build trust with patients by being empathetic, respectful, and responsive to their needs and concerns.
5. Providing access to care: Healthcare providers should ensure that patients have access to care by providing transportation, interpreting services, and other forms of support.
6. Encouraging patient engagement: Healthcare providers should encourage patients to take an active role in their care by providing them with the necessary tools and resources to manage their chronic diseases.
7. Addressing health disparities: Healthcare providers should address health disparities by providing culturally sensitive care and addressing the social determinants of health that may affect patients' health outcomes.

By using these strategies, healthcare providers can help patients with lower SES to better understand and adhere to their treatment plans, which can improve their health outcomes and reduce health disparities.","['https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2016/16_0088.htm', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5171223/', 'https://www.cdc.gov/dhdsp/health_equity/socioeconomic.htm', 'https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(20)30001-3/fulltext', 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8769588/', 'https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/44/1/258/33180/Social-Determinants-of-Health-and-Diabetes-A', 'https://www.americanactionforum.org/research/background-understanding-the-connections-between-chronic-disease-and-individual-level-risk-factors/', 'https://www.kff.org/racial-equity-and-health-policy/issue-brief/beyond-health-care-the-role-of-social-determinants-in-promoting-health-and-health-equity/', 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32106889/', 'https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2023.1114969/full', 'https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2016/16_0088.htm', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5171223/', 'https://www.cdc.gov/dhdsp/health_equity/socioeconomic.htm', 'https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(20)30001-3/fulltext', 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8769588/', 'https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/44/1/258/33180/Social-Determinants-of-Health-and-Diabetes-A', 'https://www.americanactionforum.org/research/background-understanding-the-connections-between-chronic-disease-and-individual-level-risk-factors/', 'https://www.kff.org/racial-equity-and-health-policy/issue-brief/beyond-health-care-the-role-of-social-determinants-in-promoting-health-and-health-equity/', 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32106889/', 'https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2023.1114969/full', 'https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/e2b650cd64cf84aae8ff0fae7474af82/SDOH-Evidence-Review.pdf', 'https://www.kff.org/racial-equity-and-health-policy/issue-brief/beyond-health-care-the-role-of-social-determinants-in-promoting-health-and-health-equity/', 'https://hpi.georgetown.edu/cultural/', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK425845/', 'https://www.aafp.org/about/policies/all/poverty-health.html', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6112847/', 'https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/health-equity/index.html', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4724388/', 'https://www.nia.nih.gov/about/aging-strategic-directions-research/goal-health-disparities-adults', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK425844/']",medical and clinical knowledge

These factors include:

1. Nutritional assessment: This allows healthcare providers to systematically assess the overall nutritional status of patients, including their dietary habits, nutrient deficiencies, and overall health.
2. Body Mass Index (BMI): BMI is a useful measure of overweight and obesity, and it can help healthcare providers identify patients who are at risk for chronic diseases.
3. Risk factors for diseases and conditions associated with obesity: Healthcare providers should consider the patient's risk factors for diseases and conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease.
4. Patient factors: Healthcare providers should consider the patient's age, race and ethnicity, sex, health status, and preferences when developing a treatment plan.
5. Social and structural factors: Healthcare providers should consider the patient's social and structural factors, such as their socioeconomic status, education level, and access to healthcare, when developing a treatment plan.
6. Health status and preferences: Healthcare providers should consider the patient's health status and preferences when developing a treatment plan, including their willingness to make lifestyle changes and their preferences for different treatment options.
7. Vital sign abnormalities: Healthcare providers should consider the patient's vital sign abnormalities, such as their blood pressure, blood sugar levels, and body mass index, when developing a treatment plan.
8. Degree of vital sign abnormalities: Healthcare providers should consider the degree of vital sign abnormalities, such as the severity of the patient's hypertension or diabetes, when developing a treatment plan.
9. Long-term patient health outcomes: Healthcare providers should consider the patient's long-term health outcomes, including their risk of developing chronic diseases and their quality of life, when developing a treatment plan.
10. Frequency of emergency department visits: Healthcare providers should consider the patient's frequency of emergency department visits, including the reasons for these visits and the patient's response to treatment, when developing a treatment plan.

By considering these factors, healthcare providers can develop a comprehensive treatment plan that addresses the patient's overall health status and helps them achieve their health goals.","['https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK580496/', 'https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/lose_wt/risk.htm', 'https://diabetesjournals.org/clinical/article/40/1/10/139035/Standards-of-Medical-Care-in-Diabetes-2022', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK553213/', 'https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2001/0601/p2185.html', 'https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/e2b650cd64cf84aae8ff0fae7474af82/SDOH-Evidence-Review.pdf', 'https://hpi.georgetown.edu/cultural/', 'https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2023/jan/us-health-care-global-perspective-2022', 'https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/professionals/clinical-tools-patient-management/weight-management/talking-with-your-patients-about-weight', 'https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/obesity/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20375749', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK580496/', 'https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/lose_wt/risk.htm', 'https://diabetesjournals.org/clinical/article/40/1/10/139035/Standards-of-Medical-Care-in-Diabetes-2022', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK553213/', 'https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2001/0601/p2185.html', 'https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/e2b650cd64cf84aae8ff0fae7474af82/SDOH-Evidence-Review.pdf', 'https://hpi.georgetown.edu/cultural/', 'https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2023/jan/us-health-care-global-perspective-2022', 'https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/professionals/clinical-tools-patient-management/weight-management/talking-with-your-patients-about-weight', 'https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/obesity/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20375749', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK580496/', 'https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/lose_wt/risk.htm', 'https://diabetesjournals.org/clinical/article/40/1/10/139035/Standards-of-Medical-Care-in-Diabetes-2022', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK553213/', 'https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2001/0601/p2185.html', 'https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/e2b650cd64cf84aae8ff0fae7474af82/SDOH-Evidence-Review.pdf', 'https://hpi.georgetown.edu/cultural/', 'https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2023/jan/us-health-care-global-perspective-2022', 'https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/professionals/clinical-tools-patient-management/weight-management/talking-with-your-patients-about-weight', 'https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/obesity/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20375749']",medical and clinical knowledge
"Communication: Maintain open communication with your healthcare providers. Make sure to discuss your concerns, ask questions, and seek clarification about your diagnosis and treatment plan.
Informed Consent: Always ensure that you understand the risks and benefits of any medical procedure, including the impact of medical records on a car accident claim, before giving your informed consent. This additional consideration emphasizes the importance of being well-informed not only for medical decisions but also for potential legal implications, particularly in situations involving car accidents where medical records can play a crucial role in establishing the extent of injuries and their connection to the incident.
Obtain Medical Records: Keep copies of your medical records, including test results, diagnoses, and treatment plans. These records can be crucial in the event of a malpractice claim.
Seek a Second Opinion: If you have reservations about a diagnosis or treatment plan, consider seeking a second opinion from another qualified healthcare professional.
Know Your Rights: Familiarize yourself with your rights as a patient, including the right to informed consent, the right to receive a reasonable standard of care, and the right to privacy.
Medical malpractice is a complex and multifaceted issue that demands a clear understanding of both medical and legal principles. Patients must be aware of their rights, be proactive in their healthcare, and seek legal guidance if they believe they have been victims of medical negligence. By fostering open communication with healthcare providers and staying informed, individuals can play an active role in safeguarding their well-being and holding accountable those responsible for medical malpractice.","Can a patient who has a history of elective cesarean sections still be covered under a health insurance plan that provides coverage for a vaginal delivery, even if their primary care physician recommends a trial of labor with a planned cesarean section for the next pregnancy?","The patient's eligibility for health insurance coverage for a vaginal delivery despite having a history of elective cesarean sections depends on various factors, including the specific health insurance plan, the patient's medical history, and the recommendations of their primary care physician.

The search results suggest that many women are candidates for vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) and that the success rate for VBAC is high. However, the decision to attempt a trial of labor (TOLAC) after a previous cesarean section should be made in consultation with a healthcare provider.

The Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires health insurance plans to cover pregnancy, childbirth, and related medical conditions, including VBAC. However, the specific coverage and benefits may vary depending on the insurance plan and the patient's medical history.

In general, group health plans and health insurance plans are required to cover VBAC and other pregnancy-related services, including prenatal care, delivery, and postpartum care. However, the coverage and benefits may vary depending on the specific plan and the patient's medical history.

In conclusion, the patient's eligibility for health insurance coverage for a vaginal delivery despite having a history of elective cesarean sections depends on various factors, including the specific health insurance plan, the patient's medical history, and the recommendations of their primary care physician.

"Internal medicine doctor
Internal medicine is department of medicine in which the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of internal diseases, i.e., diseases of internal organs, is carried out. The specialist in internal medicine is called an internist.
- Preventive inspections
- Acute examinations of diseases of internal organs
- Internal preoperative examinations
- Second opinion
“Second opinion” – advice and evaluation of results in medical records.
In the past, all more complex patients were treated during hospitalizations at consuls and seminars, which were attended by several physicians with different levels of experience, knowledge and sometimes even professional orientation. At the consuls and seminars, the symptoms of the disease and the results of the patient’s examinations were discussed, as well as diagnostic procedures and treatment. The patient was treated “in a group” to minimize the occurrence of a possible error.
By moving most patients to outpatient care, this way of dealing with more complex patients has disappeared. Diagnosis and treatment are carried out according to the knowledge, experience and previous practice of one doctor, considering the prescribed regulations for diagnosis and treatment. It is a routine procedure.
Second opinion is not a questioning of the professionalism or correctness of the practice of the former doctor. It is an unbiased view of another expert who can minimize such weaknesses.
Holistic medicine, complex medicine, psychosomatic medicine: it seeks to integrate individual medical disciplines in the search for the causes, manifestations and treatment of diseases.
It reflects the current reality, which is the atomization of medicine. As a result of new scientific knowledge, the atomization of medicine has caused to forget the essential thing – to heal the patient. After examination by 5-6 specialists, a patient has received a diagnosis and medication from each doctor. The patient uses several different types of drugs, and the condition does not improve – at the same time, every specialist did the right thing. Holistic medicine wants to harmonize the procedures of these doctors, find a rational way of therapy and heal the patient, not just treat him. It also considers the psychological aspect accompanying the disease.
Functional medicine, or “precision” medicine under President Obama’s HealthCare Program, is the foundation for personalized medicine.
It promotes the solution of health problems in connection with the lifestyle and general circumstances of the patient’s life. The root cause of the patient’s disease is sought, and the evolutionary aspect of the human species is considered.
The main aspects of personalized medicine can be summarized in the following definition: the right diagnosis and the right treatment for the right patient at the right time.

Some of the more common mental health diagnoses include depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and anxiety disorders, such as panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and phobias (including social phobia, agoraphobia, and other specific phobias). Often times, an individual may suffer from more than one mental impairment at a given time. For example, depression-based illnesses may co-occur with anxiety disorders or substance abuse.
Medical Treatment For Those Suffering From Mental Illnesses
Individuals who experience mental illnesses may seek medical help for their impairments. Various medical practitioners may be involved in providing medical treatment or counseling to those with mental disabilities. These providers may include:
psychiatrists– medical doctors (MD) with 4 or more years of psychiatric training (residency) following graduation from medical school. They can prescribe drugs and admit patients to the hospital.
psychologists- practitioners who have a master’s degree or PhD, but not a medical degree (MD). They can perform counseling but cannot do physical examinations, prescribe drugs (in most states), or admit patients to the hospital.
psychiatric social workers- social workers with specific training, which may include individual, marital, or family therapy. They may hold a master’s degree or a PhD. They cannot perform physical examinations or prescribe medications.
advanced practice psychiatric nurses– registered nurses (RNs) with a master’s degree or higher education and training in behavioral health. They may prescribe drugs or medications under the supervision of a licensed physician (MD).
primary physician– physicians who may be a family medicine doctor or internal medicine doctor, and who may prescribe medications or therapies to treat mental health disorders.
A mental health practitioner who provides diagnosis, treatment, or medications to an individual is required to provide a level of care and service that other such professionals would provide under similar circumstances. If this duty is breached, the mental health provider may be held liable for any resulting damages.
For example, a county mental health complex recently settled claims brought by the estate of a symphony musician who died while receiving mental health treatment. The musician, who had played with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and the Moody Blues, died of complications from sleep apnea and obesity. He was supposed to be checked every 15 minutes, according to a doctor’s order. However, there were no staff notes made in the medical record to indicate that he had been seen on the night before or the morning of his death. According to a board certified psychiatrist, “In my opinion (the patient) was admitted to the acute psychiatric unit with severe respiratory problems that were inadequately assessed and treated throughout his hospitalization such that he remained vulnerable to serious medical complications and death.”

1. Delayed recovery: Failing to address underlying emotional conflicts can prolong the recovery process, leading to prolonged suffering and decreased quality of life.
2. Increased risk of relapse: Unaddressed emotional conflicts can increase the risk of relapse, as the underlying issues are not being addressed.
3. Complicated treatment: Not addressing underlying emotional conflicts can complicate treatment, making it more challenging to achieve optimal outcomes.
4. Reduced treatment effectiveness: Failing to address underlying emotional conflicts can reduce the effectiveness of treatment, leading to decreased symptom reduction and improved functioning.
5. Increased risk of comorbidities: Unaddressed emotional conflicts can increase the risk of developing comorbidities, such as anxiety disorders, substance use disorders, and personality disorders.
6. Decreased patient engagement: Not addressing underlying emotional conflicts can lead to decreased patient engagement in treatment, as patients may feel unheard, misunderstood, or dismissed.
7. Increased risk of treatment dropout: Unaddressed emotional conflicts can increase the risk of treatment dropout, as patients may feel overwhelmed, frustrated, or hopeless.
8. Negative impact on relationships: Not addressing underlying emotional conflicts can negatively impact relationships with family, friends, and romantic partners, leading to social isolation and decreased social support.
9. Increased risk of suicidal ideation: Unaddressed emotional conflicts can increase the risk of suicidal ideation, as patients may feel hopeless, helpless, or trapped.
10. Decreased overall well-being: Failing to address underlying emotional conflicts can decrease overall well-being, leading to decreased life satisfaction, happiness, and fulfillment.

It is essential to address underlying emotional conflicts during depression treatment to ensure optimal outcomes, improve patient engagement, and reduce the risk of relapse and comorbidities.","['https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK207192/', 'https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/cognitive-behavioral-therapy/about/pac-20384610', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6181118/', 'https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/psychotherapy', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK207195/', 'https://www.samhsa.gov/find-help/disaster-distress-helpline/warning-signs-risk-factors', 'https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1755738012471029', 'https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/conditionsandtreatments/depression-treatment-and-management', 'https://www2.ed.gov/documents/students/supporting-child-student-social-emotional-behavioral-mental-health.pdf', 'https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/8933', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK207192/', 'https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/cognitive-behavioral-therapy/about/pac-20384610', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6181118/', 'https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/psychotherapy', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK207195/', 'https://www.samhsa.gov/find-help/disaster-distress-helpline/warning-signs-risk-factors', 'https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1755738012471029', 'https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/conditionsandtreatments/depression-treatment-and-management', 'https://www2.ed.gov/documents/students/supporting-child-student-social-emotional-behavioral-mental-health.pdf', 'https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/8933', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK207192/', 'https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/cognitive-behavioral-therapy/about/pac-20384610', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6181118/', 'https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/psychotherapy', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK207195/', 'https://www.samhsa.gov/find-help/disaster-distress-helpline/warning-signs-risk-factors', 'https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1755738012471029', 'https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/conditionsandtreatments/depression-treatment-and-management', 'https://www2.ed.gov/documents/students/supporting-child-student-social-emotional-behavioral-mental-health.pdf', 'https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/8933', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK207192/', 'https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/cognitive-behavioral-therapy/about/pac-20384610', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6181118/', 'https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/psychotherapy', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK207195/', 'https://www.samhsa.gov/find-help/disaster-distress-helpline/warning-signs-risk-factors', 'https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1755738012471029', 'https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/conditionsandtreatments/depression-treatment-and-management', 'https://www2.ed.gov/documents/students/supporting-child-student-social-emotional-behavioral-mental-health.pdf', 'https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/8933']",medical and clinical knowledge

On the one hand, remote work can provide a sense of flexibility and autonomy, which can lead to increased job satisfaction and reduced stress. Additionally, remote work can also provide opportunities for people to work in a setting that is more conducive to their individual needs, such as working from home with a disability or caring for a family member. On the other hand, remote work can also lead to feelings of isolation and disconnection from colleagues and friends, which can negatively impact mental health.

How are computers used in medicine and health care?
Introduction to Computers in Medicine and Healthcare
As we move deeper into the digital era, the marriage of technology and healthcare is becoming increasingly prominent. Computers are no longer just tools for entertainment or work; they now play a critical role in maintaining our health and managing diseases.
From electronic health records to robotic surgery, computers are revolutionizing the way we approach healthcare. They're helping us detect diseases earlier, manage patient data more efficiently, and even perform complex surgeries with precision that was previously impossible. Let's explore some of these applications in more depth.
Electronic Health Records (EHRs)
One of the most significant ways that computers are used in healthcare is through Electronic Health Records, or EHRs. These digital versions of patient medical histories are far more efficient, accurate, and accessible than their paper counterparts.
With EHRs, healthcare providers can quickly access a patient's complete medical history, including past diagnoses, treatments, and test results. This not only saves time but also ensures that doctors have the most accurate and up-to-date information when making health decisions. Plus, since EHRs can be shared across different healthcare systems, they can also greatly improve the coordination of care.
Medical Imaging and Radiology
Computers have significantly improved the field of medical imaging. They're used to capture, store, and analyze images from various modalities, such as X-rays, MRIs, CT scans, and ultrasounds. These images are then used to diagnose illnesses, monitor progress, and plan treatments.
Moreover, with the aid of sophisticated software, computers can help radiologists detect abnormalities that might be missed by the human eye. They can also reduce the amount of radiation exposure by optimizing the imaging parameters.
Telemedicine and Virtual Care
The advent of the internet and advances in communication technologies have made telemedicine a reality. Through telemedicine, patients can consult with healthcare providers from the comfort of their homes, saving them time and reducing the risk of exposure to infectious diseases.
Telemedicine is particularly beneficial for people living in remote areas, where access to healthcare can be challenging. It's also a great tool for managing chronic conditions, as it allows for regular check-ups without the need for frequent hospital visits.
Robotic Surgery and Assistive Technology
Robotic surgery is another area where computers are making a significant impact. With robotic systems, surgeons can perform complex procedures with more precision, flexibility, and control than is possible with traditional techniques.
Robotic surgery is less invasive, which means less pain, less blood loss, and shorter recovery times for patients. Additionally, with assistive technologies like computer-aided design and 3D printing, we can now create customized prosthetics and implants for individual patients.
Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Healthcare
The last but certainly not the least important application of computers in healthcare is the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. These technologies are being used to predict patient outcomes, support clinical decisions, and even discover new drugs.
AI algorithms can analyze large amounts of data and identify patterns that might go unnoticed by humans. This can help us predict disease outbreaks, identify high-risk patients, and recommend personalized treatment plans. Despite the potential challenges and ethical considerations, the benefits of AI and machine learning in healthcare are profound and far-reaching.
In conclusion, computers are undeniably revolutionizing the field of medicine and healthcare. With the ongoing advances in technology, their role is only set to become more integral and pervasive in our healthcare systems.

"Alternative medicine also values prevention, but its approach may differ. You can emphasize prevention through diet, herbal medicine, relaxation therapy, and other natural practices. Some alternative therapies focus on strengthening the immune system and promoting self-reflection to prevent illness.
Access and cost
Access to these types of medicine can vary significantly. Traditional, in general, is available in conventional health care systems, and is usually covered by health insurance. However, the cost of traditional healthcare can be high, especially in cases of specialized treatments or chronic illnesses.
Alternative medicine is often found outside the conventional healthcare system, and may not be covered by insurance. This can make alternative medicine somewhat inaccessible to many people due to financial constraints. At the same time, some argue that alternative medicine offers affordable alternatives to expensive and invasive treatments.
Focus on health philosophy
One of the most notable aspects, in this contrast between traditional medicine and alternative medicine, is its philosophy on topics such as health and illness. The first is based on the biomedical model, which views disease as a physical and biological process that can be diagnosed and treated through specific medical interventions. This method tends to focus on eliminating symptoms and correcting physiological imbalances.
On the other hand, the alternative mode adopts more holistic views, and considers health to be a state of balance between the body, mind and spirit. It focuses on treating the whole individual and addressing the underlying causes of illness, including emotional and spiritual factors.
Treatments and therapies
The range of treatments and therapies in both cases is wide, and varies depending on the discipline and philosophy of each approach.
In traditional methodology, common treatments include pharmacological medications, surgery, physical therapy and rehabilitation, and treatments based on scientific evidence. These are based on clinical research, and are supported by strong evidence of effectiveness and safety.
In contrast, alternative medicine is based on a number of approaches that can include acupuncture, homeopathy, massage therapy, yoga therapy, herbal medicine, aromatherapy, and more. These treatments do not have a solid scientific basis, and may be centered on cultural traditions and personal experiences. The effectiveness and safety of alternative therapies can vary widely, posing challenges in evaluating their efficacy.
Regulation and certification
Another significant difference between both approaches is the regulation and certification of professionals. Doctors and health professionals, in the field of traditional medicine, are subject to strict academic training requirements, which is why they are regulated by government health organizations. Training includes years of study at accredited medical schools and medical residencies.
While alternative medicine, on the other hand, lacks a uniform regulatory system. Alternative therapy practitioners can have a wide variety of backgrounds and training levels, from short courses to more extensive programs. However, this may raise concerns about the competence and quality of care provided by alternative professionals.
Traditional medicine is largely based on scientific evidence and clinical research. Treatments and drugs undergo clinical trials and peer review studies to evaluate their effectiveness and safety. This ensures that patients receive treatments supported by solid evidence.
Alternative medicine is based on personal experience, tradition and anecdotal testimony. Although some alternative treatments may show benefits for certain conditions, the lack of rigorous scientific research often raises questions about their effectiveness and safety.
Complementarity in medical practice
In some cases, the idea that traditional medicine and alternative medicine can complement each other in health care has been promoted. This is known as integrative medicine or complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). The idea is that, by combining traditional and alternative approaches, patients can benefit from a more complete and personalized treatment.
As medicine evolves and diversifies, it is essential to understand the differences between traditional and alternative approaches. Both have their own advantages and challenges, and your choice may depend on personal beliefs, patient needs, and resource availability. Collaboration between traditional medicine and alternative medicine professionals can offer a comprehensive approach to healthcare, providing patients with options and opportunities to improve their well-being.",How might the historical development of philosophies on the nature of disease influence the current debate on the effectiveness of alternative medicine in treating chronic illnesses?,"The historical development of philosophies on the nature of disease has significantly influenced the current debate on the effectiveness of alternative medicine in treating chronic illnesses. This influence can be seen in the various perspectives and approaches that have emerged over time.

The ancient Greeks, for example, believed that disease was a natural consequence of an imbalance in the body's ""humors,"" and that treatment involved restoring balance through diet, exercise, and other lifestyle changes. This perspective has influenced the development of alternative medicine practices such as Ayurveda and traditional Chinese medicine, which emphasize the importance of maintaining balance and harmony in the body.

In contrast, the modern Western medical perspective, which emerged in the 19th century, views disease as a result of external factors such as bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens. This perspective has led to the development of evidence-based medicine, which emphasizes the use of scientific research and clinical trials to determine the effectiveness of treatments.

The debate over the effectiveness of alternative medicine in treating chronic illnesses is influenced by these different perspectives. Some proponents of alternative medicine argue that it offers a more holistic approach to health and wellness, and that it can be effective in treating conditions that are not well-addressed by conventional medicine. Others argue that alternative medicine is not supported by scientific evidence and that it can be harmful if used in place of conventional treatment.

Ultimately, the effectiveness of alternative medicine in treating chronic illnesses will depend on a variety of factors, including the specific condition being treated, the quality of the treatment, and the individual patient's response to treatment.","['https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-020-0420-9', 'https://academic.oup.com/heapro/article/24/2/185/568653', 'https://medicalhumanities.artsandsciences.baylor.edu/prospective-students/course-descriptions', 'http://collegecatalog.uchicago.edu/thecollege/scienceandmedicinehips/', 'https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/history/', 'https://www.westernu.edu/mediafiles/osteopathic/osteopathicphilosophy_history.pdf', 'https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/health-disease/', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S003936812200084X', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5308004/', 'https://history.princeton.edu/fields/history-science', 'https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-020-0420-9', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7217401/', 'https://www.nature.com/articles/s41573-020-00114-z', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8744804/', 'https://academic.oup.com/heapro/article/24/2/185/568653', 'https://www.westernu.edu/mediafiles/osteopathic/osteopathicphilosophy_history.pdf', 'https://www.stkate.edu/healthcare-degrees/what-is-holistic-health', 'https://globalwellnessinstitute.org/what-is-wellness/history-of-wellness/', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_science', 'https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/cam', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3068720/', 'https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/rr/rr6501e1.htm', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5390355/', 'https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/cam', 'https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2020/jan/us-health-care-global-perspective-2019', 'https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/complementary-alternative-or-integrative-health-whats-in-a-name', 'https://www.va.gov/WHOLEHEALTH/professional-resources/clinician-tools/Evidence-Based-Research.asp', 'https://www.aafp.org/about/policies/all/poverty-health.html', 'https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/meditation-and-mindfulness-what-you-need-to-know', 'https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-019-0675-0']",medical and clinical knowledge

The limitations of relying solely on diagnostic tests to determine the cause of a chronic illness are multifaceted and far-reaching. These limitations include the potential for misdiagnosis, incomplete diagnosis, and failure to consider the complex interplay between physical, emotional, and psychological factors that contribute to chronic illness.

A more holistic approach to health can help address these limitations by considering the physical, emotional, and psychological aspects of a patient's condition. This approach recognizes that chronic illness is a complex and dynamic process that requires a comprehensive and individualized treatment plan. By incorporating complementary and alternative therapies, such as yoga, meditation, and acupuncture, into a patient's treatment plan, healthcare providers can help patients manage their symptoms, improve their quality of life, and reduce their risk of developing chronic diseases.

In addition, a holistic approach to health can help address the social and environmental factors that contribute to chronic illness, such as poverty, lack of access to healthcare, and environmental toxins. By addressing these underlying factors, healthcare providers can help patients develop healthy habits and behaviors that can help them manage their chronic illness and improve their overall health and well-being.

Overall, a holistic approach to health can help address the limitations of relying solely on diagnostic tests to determine the cause of a chronic illness by providing a comprehensive and individualized treatment plan that considers the physical, emotional, and psychological aspects of a patient's condition.","['https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK338593/', 'https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/rr/rr6501e1.htm', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470276/', 'https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/multiple-sclerosis-ms', 'https://www.cms.gov/files/document/mln1986542-medicare-mental-health-coverage.pdf', 'https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/enforcement-guidance-disability-related-inquiries-and-medical-examinations-employees', 'https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21493-cardiovascular-disease', 'https://www.cms.gov/files/document/2024-announcement-pdf.pdf', 'https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-and-dementia/alzheimers-disease-fact-sheet', 'https://www.cms.gov/medicare/enrollment-renewal/special-needs-plans/chronic-conditions', 'https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2019/19_0081.htm', 'https://academic.oup.com/jamiaopen/article/7/2/ooae027/7642289', 'https://fedeltahomecare.com/home-care-blog/what-are-the-benefits-of-a-holistic-approach-to-chronic-disease-management/', 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35726840/', 'https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/complementary-alternative-or-integrative-health-whats-in-a-name', 'https://www.managedhealthcareexecutive.com/view/enhancing-provider-patient-relationships-to-reverse-chronic-disease', 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13548506.2022.2088815', 'https://www.floridamedicalclinic.com/blog/chronic-disease-management/', 'https://www.medicaleconomics.com/view/addressing-chronic-disease-requires-holistic-personalized-approach-to-care', 'https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/palliative-care', 'https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2019/19_0081.htm', 'https://fedeltahomecare.com/home-care-blog/what-are-the-benefits-of-a-holistic-approach-to-chronic-disease-management/', 'https://academic.oup.com/jamiaopen/article/7/2/ooae027/7642289', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6467249/', 'https://www.floridamedicalclinic.com/blog/chronic-disease-management/', 'https://www.medicaleconomics.com/view/addressing-chronic-disease-requires-holistic-personalized-approach-to-care', 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35726840/', 'https://www.managedhealthcareexecutive.com/view/enhancing-provider-patient-relationships-to-reverse-chronic-disease', 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13548506.2022.2088815', 'https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/complementary-alternative-or-integrative-health-whats-in-a-name']",medical and clinical knowledge
"Create a 10–12-slide PowerPoint presentation to identify medications associated with a chosen disease or health condition, explain the actions and side effects of the medications, and discuss any controversies related to the medications. Explain a treatment regime, including pharmacology, for the disease or health condition you selected, along with how the treatment regime may affect a client’s lifestyle.
By having a thorough understanding of pharmacology, nurses can eliminate possible medication errors in their nursing practices. The basic principles of pharmacology include pharmacokinetics (what the body does to a drug) and pharmacodynamics (what a drug does to the body). Pharmacology plays a significant role in the nursing profession, so it is extremely important for nurses to understand the actions of the pharmacological agents they will administer to patients in order to intervene appropriately if necessary.
Another critical skill for a nurse is the ability to apply and evaluate evidence-based practices, principles, models, and pharmacological guidelines and protocols commonly used in nursing practice. Understanding how specific protocols and guidelines are developed will aid nurses in treating patients with a multitude of physiological and psychological conditions.
Nurses must be able to measure outcomes of pharmacological interventions when caring for patients. The effective use of evidence-based practice guidelines, models, and principles is one way that nurses can analyze quality outcomes for the pharmacological treatments used for patients.
Pharmacology includes different categories of major drugs used in the treatment of primary diseases. The same drug may be used to treat more than one disease or condition, while two patients with the same disease may require different drug treatments. In addition, the professional nurse must be aware of what types of things can influence a patient’s response to a drug. Some things are obvious—other medications, for example—while some are less so. Things like age, weight, herbs—even foods people eat every day—can influence how a person responds to a particular drug. At times, even a strong cultural belief can influence how a drug will react. Nurses who administer drugs have a responsibility to assess patients for both the desired response, as well as for any unwanted and potentially harmful reactions that may occur.
Imagine your supervisor has asked you to conduct a lunch and learn session to educate your fellow nursing staff on pharmacological interventions.
Select a disease or health condition that requires pharmacological intervention. You may choose any disease or health condition you wish, but the disease or health condition must be relevant to nurses from a variety of settings (for example: ER, pediatrics, public health, et cetera).
Once you have selected a disease or health condition, create a PowerPoint presentation you could use in your lunch and learn session, including the following:
- Identify the disease or health condition you have chosen, along with the areas where nurses are likely to see it. (Do this in the agenda slide or next slide after the agenda.)
- Identify the three drugs used most often in the treatment of the disease or health condition.
- Explain the types of actions, side effects, indications, and contraindications that could be expected from the pharmacological treatment.
- Describe the treatment regime most often prescribed for the disease or health condition. This should include pharmacology but not be limited to pharmacology.
- Explain how the treatment regime (including pharmacology) may impact a client’s lifestyle. Consider things such as finances, ease or complexity of administration, instructions (frequency, duration), et cetera.
- Describe how a nurse should monitor a client being treated for the disease or health condition in order to obtain a quality patient outcome.
- Explain any controversies associated with the drugs used in the treatment. For example, is there a black box warning with any of the drugs?
Use the notes section of each slide to expand your points or draft your mock oral presentation (or both) and reference your resources. Use at least 3 peer-reviewed or professional resources to support your work in this assessment. Be sure your PowerPoint includes a title slide, a slide with your agenda or list of topics to be covered, and a reference slide. Follow current APA style and formatting guidelines for your citations and references.
- Number of slides: 10–12, not including the title and reference slides.
- Be creative.

Pharmacology includes different categories of major drugs used in the treatment of primary diseases. The same drug may be used to treat more than one disease or condition, while two patients with the same disease may require different drug treatments. In addition, the professional nurse must be aware of what types of things can influence a patient’s response to a drug. Some things are obvious—other medications, for example—while some are less so. Things like age, weight, herbs—even foods people eat every day—can influence how a person responds to a particular drug. At times, even a strong cultural belief can influence how a drug will react. Nurses who administer drugs have a responsibility to assess patients for both the desired response, as well as for any unwanted and potentially harmful reactions that may occur.
Imagine your supervisor has asked you to conduct a lunch and learn session to educate your fellow nursing staff on pharmacological interventions.
Select a disease or health condition that requires pharmacological intervention. You may choose any disease or health condition you wish, but the disease or health condition must be relevant to nurses from a variety of settings (for example: ER, pediatrics, public health, et cetera).
Once you have selected a disease or health condition, create a PowerPoint presentation you could use in your lunch and learn session, including the following:
- Identify the disease or health condition you have chosen, along with the areas where nurses are likely to see it. (Do this in the agenda slide or next slide after the agenda.)
- Identify the three drugs used most often in the treatment of the disease or health condition.
- Explain the types of actions, side effects, indications, and contraindications that could be expected from the pharmacological treatment.
- Describe the treatment regime most often prescribed for the disease or health condition. This should include pharmacology but not be limited to pharmacology.
- Explain how the treatment regime (including pharmacology) may impact a client’s lifestyle. Consider things such as finances, ease or complexity of administration, instructions (frequency, duration), et cetera.
- Describe how a nurse should monitor a client being treated for the disease or health condition in order to obtain a quality patient outcome.
- Explain any controversies associated with the drugs used in the treatment. For example, is there a black box warning with any of the drugs?
Use the notes section of each slide to expand your points or draft your mock oral presentation (or both) and reference your resources. Use at least 3 peer-reviewed or professional resources to support your work in this assessment. Be sure your PowerPoint includes a title slide, a slide with your agenda or list of topics to be covered, and a reference slide. Follow current APA style and formatting guidelines for your citations and references.

"Create a 10–12-slide PowerPoint presentation to identify medications associated with a chosen disease or health condition, explain the actions and side effects of the medications, and discuss any controversies related to the medications. Explain a treatment regime, including pharmacology, for the disease or health condition you selected, along with how the treatment regime may affect a client’s lifestyle.
By having a thorough understanding of pharmacology, nurses can eliminate possible medication errors in their nursing practices. The basic principles of pharmacology include pharmacokinetics (what the body does to a drug) and pharmacodynamics (what a drug does to the body). Pharmacology plays a significant role in the nursing profession, so it is extremely important for nurses to understand the actions of the pharmacological agents they will administer to patients in order to intervene appropriately if necessary.
Another critical skill for a nurse is the ability to apply and evaluate evidence-based practices, principles, models, and pharmacological guidelines and protocols commonly used in nursing practice. Understanding how specific protocols and guidelines are developed will aid nurses in treating patients with a multitude of physiological and psychological conditions.

1. Provide clear and concise information: Patients with mild asthma may not fully understand the importance of adhering to their medication regimen. Providing clear and concise information about the benefits of medication and the risks of non-adherence can help patients make informed decisions about their treatment.

2. Use visual aids: Visual aids such as diagrams, charts, and pictures can help patients understand complex information about their medication regimen. For example, a diagram of the lungs can help patients understand how inhaled corticosteroids work to reduce inflammation.

3. Involve patients in the decision-making process: Patients with mild asthma should be involved in the decision-making process regarding their treatment. This can include discussing treatment options, setting goals, and monitoring progress.

4. Offer ongoing support: Patients with mild asthma may need ongoing support to adhere to their medication regimen. This can include regular follow-up appointments with a healthcare provider, phone or video consultations, and online resources.

5. Encourage patient education: Patients with mild asthma should be encouraged to educate themselves about their condition and treatment options. This can include reading educational materials, attending support groups, and participating in online forums.

6. Use patient-centered language: Patients with mild asthma should be communicated with in a patient-centered manner. This means using language that is easy to understand, avoiding technical jargon, and focusing on the patient's needs and concerns.

7. Provide medication reminders: Patients with mild asthma may need reminders to take their medication. This can include setting reminders on a phone or calendar, using a medication reminder app, or receiving reminders from a healthcare provider.

8. Monitor adherence: Patients with mild asthma should be monitored for adherence to their medication regimen. This can include tracking medication use, monitoring symptoms, and conducting regular follow-up appointments.

By considering these approaches, healthcare providers can effectively educate patients with mild asthma on the importance of adhering to their medication regimen, including inhaled corticosteroids and bronchodilators.","['https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/files/docs/guidelines/asthma_qrg.pdf', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK551631/', 'https://www.nature.com/articles/s41533-023-00330-1', 'https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-induced-asthma-beyond-the-basics', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8865583/', 'https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiating-asthma-therapy-and-monitoring-in-adolescents-and-adults', 'https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/asthma/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20369660', 'https://allergyasthmanetwork.org/news/asthma-smart-therapy/', 'https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asthma-treatment-in-adolescents-and-adults-beyond-the-basics/print', 'https://www.jaci-inpractice.org/article/S2213-2198(23)00052-1/fulltext', 'https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/files/docs/guidelines/asthma_qrg.pdf', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK551631/', 'https://www.nature.com/articles/s41533-023-00330-1', 'https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-induced-asthma-beyond-the-basics', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8865583/', 'https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiating-asthma-therapy-and-monitoring-in-adolescents-and-adults', 'https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/asthma/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20369660', 'https://allergyasthmanetwork.org/news/asthma-smart-therapy/', 'https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asthma-treatment-in-adolescents-and-adults-beyond-the-basics/print', 'https://www.jaci-inpractice.org/article/S2213-2198(23)00052-1/fulltext', 'https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/files/docs/guidelines/asthma_qrg.pdf', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK551631/', 'https://www.nature.com/articles/s41533-023-00330-1', 'https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-induced-asthma-beyond-the-basics', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8865583/', 'https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initiating-asthma-therapy-and-monitoring-in-adolescents-and-adults', 'https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/asthma/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20369660', 'https://allergyasthmanetwork.org/news/asthma-smart-therapy/', 'https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asthma-treatment-in-adolescents-and-adults-beyond-the-basics/print', 'https://www.jaci-inpractice.org/article/S2213-2198(23)00052-1/fulltext']",medical and clinical knowledge
"Researchers are searching for new information and new answers to problems. Because of this, most research is not intended to provide you with direct benefits. Research can also have serious risks. When you participate in research, you are mostly contributing to scientific progress and helping society.
Research is not the same as treatment. In medical research, many of the drugs, devices and procedures being tested are experimental. This means that they have not been proven to work. There may be unknown risks. Although being in a medical study might help you, nobody can guarantee a direct benefit for you.
Payment will be explained to you during the informed consent process. Some studies do not have the resources to pay you. Other studies might pay you for the time and effort it takes to participate. The money is usually only enough to cover expenses (parking, transportation, meals, etc.) and maybe for some of the time you spend away from work.
The payment should not be enough to convince you to take risks that you normally would not take.
If you leave before the end of the research, you will usually be paid for that portion of the research you complete.
The most important thing to do is take an active role and communicate with the study team before, during and after the research. You should always ask questions if you are not clear about something, if you are curious about something, or if it seems like the research plan is different from what you were told. You have a right to have your questions answered. Take your time making decisions about whether or not to participate. You should seek the advice of trusted family members, friends or healthcare professionals before and during the research.
If you feel uncomfortable with what you are doing, or if you think you might be experiencing changes in your health (whether good or bad), let the study team know so that they can help you. Always keep in mind that participation in research is voluntary. If you feel like you are being pressured to join or stay in a study, you can always say no. You can leave the research at any time for any reason, and you do not have to explain your decision.
You can also contact our office with questions about your rights, or any problems or complaints about your experience with research at UCI.

"Directed Enzyme Prodrug Therapy (DEPT) uses enzymes artificially introduced into the body to convert Prodrugs, which have no or poor biological activity, to the active form in the desired location within the body. Many chemotherapy drugs for cancer lack tumour specificity and the doses required to reach therapeutic levels in the tumour are often toxic to other tissues. DEPT strategies are an experimental method of reducing the systemic toxicity of a drug, by achieving high levels of the active drug only at the desired site. This article describes the variations of DEPT technology.
Antibody-directed enzyme prodrug therapy (ADEPT)
ADEPT is a strategy to overcome the problems of lack of tumor selectivity. An antibody designed/developed against a tumor antigen is linked to an enzyme and injected to the blood, resulting in selective binding of the enzyme in the tumor. When the discrimination between tumor and normal tissue enzyme levels is sufficient, a prodrug is administrated into the blood circulation, which is converted to an active cytotoxic drug by the enzyme, only within the tumor. Selectivity is achieved by the tumor specificity of the antibody and by delaying prodrug administration until there is a large differential between tumor and normal tissue enzyme levels.
Medicine is an open access peer-reviewedmedical journal published by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. It was established in 1922. Of general medical journals still in publication since 1959, Medicine had the highest number of citations per paper between 1959 and 2009. The journal covers all aspects of clinical medicine. On March 31, 2014 Medicine changed into an open access publication, publishing in a broad spectrum of medical specialties.
This article deals with medicine as practiced by trained professionals from ancient times to the present. Early medical traditions include those of Babylon, China, Egypt and India. The Greeks went even further, introducing the concepts of medical diagnosis, prognosis, and advanced medical ethics. The Hippocratic Oath, still taken (although significantly changed from the original) by doctors up to today, was written in Greece in the 5th century BCE. In the medieval age, surgical practices inherited from the ancient masters were improved and then systematized in Rogerius'sThe Practice of Surgery. Universities began systematic training of physicians around the years 1220 in Italy. During the Renaissance, understanding of anatomy improved, and the microscope was invented. The germ theory of disease in the 19th century led to cures for many infectious diseases. Military doctors advanced the methods of trauma treatment and surgery. Public health measures were developed especially in the 19th century as the rapid growth of cities required systematic sanitary measures. Advanced research centers opened in the early 20th century, often connected with major hospitals. The mid-20th century was characterized by new biological treatments, such as antibiotics. These advancements, along with developments in chemistry, genetics, and lab technology (such as the x-ray) led to modern medicine. Medicine was heavily professionalized in the 20th century, and new careers opened to women as nurses (from the 1870s) and as physicians (especially after 1970). The 21st century is characterized by highly advanced research involving numerous fields of science.

"Directed Enzyme Prodrug Therapy (DEPT) uses enzymes artificially introduced into the body to convert Prodrugs, which have no or poor biological activity, to the active form in the desired location within the body. Many chemotherapy drugs for cancer lack tumour specificity and the doses required to reach therapeutic levels in the tumour are often toxic to other tissues. DEPT strategies are an experimental method of reducing the systemic toxicity of a drug, by achieving high levels of the active drug only at the desired site. This article describes the variations of DEPT technology.
Antibody-directed enzyme prodrug therapy (ADEPT)
ADEPT is a strategy to overcome the problems of lack of tumor selectivity. An antibody designed/developed against a tumor antigen is linked to an enzyme and injected to the blood, resulting in selective binding of the enzyme in the tumor. When the discrimination between tumor and normal tissue enzyme levels is sufficient, a prodrug is administrated into the blood circulation, which is converted to an active cytotoxic drug by the enzyme, only within the tumor. Selectivity is achieved by the tumor specificity of the antibody and by delaying prodrug administration until there is a large differential between tumor and normal tissue enzyme levels.
Medicine is an open access peer-reviewedmedical journal published by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. It was established in 1922. Of general medical journals still in publication since 1959, Medicine had the highest number of citations per paper between 1959 and 2009. The journal covers all aspects of clinical medicine. On March 31, 2014 Medicine changed into an open access publication, publishing in a broad spectrum of medical specialties.

"3 Best Practices for Shared Decision-Making in Healthcare
Shared decision-making isn’t an entirely new system and exists in some form or another in all healthcare systems over the world. The shared decision-making process involves patients and healthcare professionals working together to make decisions, improving patient engagement and the quality of healthcare services.
Shared decision-making has numerous benefits. It allows patients to discuss their issues with healthcare professionals more openly and get a clearer picture of what the healthcare professionals are trying to do.
Keep reading this article to learn more about some practices that can help improve the shared decision-making process in the healthcare sector.
Practice # 1: Assist Patients To Understand Options
Healthcare isn’t an objective field. Treatments vary from patient to patient. Hence, it’s extremely important to understand patients’ priorities and concerns to figure out their preferences.
Helping patients evaluate their available options based on their concerns and goals will improve shared decision-making.
Practice # 2: Inform them of the Benefits and Risks
The only way the shared decision-making process can be successful is by giving patients all the relevant information. It’s crucial to educate patients and offer them relevant information based on the best and reliable scientific evidence.
This doesn’t end here; it’s also important to make sure and check back with patients if they’re clear on the information provided to them.
Practice # 3: Give Patients The Confidence To Stick With Their Decision
Once the patient has understood all the risks and benefits regarding their issue and has decided what they want to do, it’s important to make sure they follow through with their decision.
Informing the patient of the next steps, checking for understanding, and discussing any challenges they might face with their decision, are all part of helping them follow through on their decision.
Reach Out To IHBR To Enhance Communication Skills in Clinical Practice
One of the most crucial elements of easily accessible healthcare is its ability to provide patients with the opportunity to make decisions about their health conditions with improved physician-patient communication.
