"Federalism is a mode of administration that combines a single political system of the central or ""federal"" government with regional governments (provincial, state, cantonal, territorial, or other subunit governments). Its distinguishing feature initially embodied in the innovative system of government established by the United States Constitution of 1789, is a parity relationship between the two tiers of government. It is thus characterized as a type of governance in which powers are split between two equal levels of authority.
Federalism is distinct from confederalism, in which the general level of government is subservient to the regional level, and devolution within a unitary state, in which the regional level of government is subordinate to the general level. It is the primary form in the pathway of regional integration or separation, restricted on one side by confederalism and on the other by devolution within a unitary state. India, United States, Malaysia, Brazil, Mexico, Germany, Russia, Canada, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Switzerland, Argentina, Belgium, Pakistan, Nigeria, and Australia are examples of federations or federal states. Some regard the European Union as a forerunner to federalism in a multi-state setting, a concept known as the federal union of states.
Federalism and India
Federalism in India refers to the relation between India's Central Government and its state governments. The Indian Constitution establishes the framework of the Indian government. Part XI of the Indian constitution stipulates the division of legislative, administrative, and executive functions between the union government and the Indian states. The legislative powers are split into three lists: the Union List, the State List, and the Concurrent List, which represent the powers conferred on the Union government, the State governments, and the powers shared among them.
This federalism is symmetrical in the sense that the delegated powers of the constituent entities are envisioned to be the same. Because of an intentionally temporary section of the Indian Constitution known as Article 370, the state of Jammu and Kashmir has historically been afforded a different status than other states (which was revoked by the Parliament in 2019). Union territories are unitary in nature, ruled directly by the Union administration. Article 1 (1) of the constitution provides for two levels of government, with an extra local elected government. Articles 239AA and 239A granted legislatures to Delhi and Puducherry, respectively.
The Parliament of India, a bicameral legislature comprising the Rajya Sabha and the Lok Sabha, wields legislative powers. The Rajya Sabha (or the 'Council of States') is the upper house of parliament, consisting of members appointed by the president and elected by state and territorial legislatures. The Lok Sabha (also known as the 'House of the People') is the lower house. Because its legislation is subject to judicial review by the Supreme Court, the parliament does not have complete control and sovereignty.
It does, however, have some influence over the executive. Members of the Council of Ministers, including the Prime Minister, are either appointed by parliament or elected within six months of taking office. The Lok Sabha holds the council as a whole accountable. The Lok Sabha is a transitory house that can be dissolved only if the ruling party loses the support of a majority of its members. The Rajya Sabha is an indefinite house that can never be dissolved. The Rajya Sabha members are elected for a six-year tenure.
The constitution defines the distribution of powers, and legislative powers are separated into three lists:
Union List: The Union List consists of 100 items (up from 97 before) on which the parliament has sole legislative authority. Defence, armed forces, arms and ammunition, atomic energy, foreign affairs, war and peace, citizenship, extradition, railways, shipping and navigation, airways, posts and telegraphs, telephones, wireless and broadcasting, currency, foreign trade, inter-state trade and commerce, banking, insurance, industry control, regulation, and development of mines, mineral, and oil resources are all included.
State List: There are 61 items on the State List (earlier 66 items). Maintaining law and order, police forces, healthcare, transportation, land policies, energy in the state, village administration, and so on are all topics where uniformity is desirable but not required. The state legislature has sole authority to enact legislation on these topics. The Rajya Sabha (Council of States) must pass a resolution with a two-thirds majority that it is expedient to act in the national interest in order for the parliament to create legislation on subjects listed in the State List in specific circumstances. Though states have sole legislative authority over items on the State List, articles 249, 250, 252, and 253 provide circumstances in which the Union government may legislate.","How would the Indian government's ability to respond to natural disasters be affected if the power to declare national emergencies was not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution, but was instead implied as a necessary function of the central government?",The absence of explicit mention of national emergency powers in the Indian Constitution could lead to confusion and potential delays in responding to natural disasters.,"['https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/12.31', 'https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46379', 'https://www.congress.gov/bill/94th-congress/house-bill/3884', 'https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-addressing-threat-posed-tiktok/', 'https://www.senate.gov/about/resources/pdf/report-national-emergencies-1976.pdf', 'https://www.state.gov/executive-order-13224/', 'https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1701', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8250373/', 'https://www.idea.int/sites/default/files/publications/emergency-powers-primer.pdf', 'https://www.fema.gov/disaster/defense-production-act', 'https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/12.31', 'https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46379', 'https://www.congress.gov/bill/94th-congress/house-bill/3884', 'https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-addressing-threat-posed-tiktok/', 'https://www.senate.gov/about/resources/pdf/report-national-emergencies-1976.pdf', 'https://www.state.gov/executive-order-13224/', 'https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1701', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8250373/', 'https://www.idea.int/sites/default/files/publications/emergency-powers-primer.pdf', 'https://www.fema.gov/disaster/defense-production-act', 'https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/12.31', 'https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46379', 'https://www.congress.gov/bill/94th-congress/house-bill/3884', 'https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-addressing-threat-posed-tiktok/', 'https://www.senate.gov/about/resources/pdf/report-national-emergencies-1976.pdf', 'https://www.state.gov/executive-order-13224/', 'https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1701', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8250373/', 'https://www.idea.int/sites/default/files/publications/emergency-powers-primer.pdf', 'https://www.fema.gov/disaster/defense-production-act']",politics

However, the implementation of such a law would have implications on federalism in India, as it would encroach upon the powers of the state governments.

The Union government's power to regulate the price of milk production is based on the Commerce Clause of the Constitution, which gives the Union government the power to regulate interstate and foreign commerce. The Union government can also regulate the price of milk production under the Essential Commodities Act, 1955, which allows the Union government to regulate the production, supply, and distribution of essential commodities, including milk.

However, the implementation of such a law would have implications on federalism in India, as it would encroach upon the powers of the state governments. The state governments have the power to regulate the production, supply, and distribution of milk within their respective territories, and any attempt by the Union government to regulate the price of milk production would be seen as an encroachment upon their powers.

Furthermore, the implementation of such a law would also have implications on the federal structure of the country, as it would create a centralized system of governance, where the Union government would have more control over the economy and the state governments would have less autonomy. This could lead to a concentration of power in the hands of the Union government, which could be detrimental to the federal structure of the country.

In conclusion, while the Union government has the power to regulate the price of milk production under the Constitution of India, the implementation of such a law would have implications on federalism in India, and would require careful consideration of the powers of the Union government and the state governments.","['https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/imf-and-covid19/Policy-Responses-to-COVID-19', 'https://apps.fas.usda.gov/newgainapi/api/Report/DownloadReportByFileName?fileName=Dairy%20and%20Products%20Annual_New%20Delhi_India_IN2023-0072.pdf', 'https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Importing%20into%20the%20U.S.pdf', 'https://www.europarl.europa.eu/cmsdata/219887/Pesticides%20health%20and%20food.pdf', 'https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-2/subtitle-A/chapter-II/part-200', 'https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2617', 'https://agriculture.ec.europa.eu/farming/animal-products/milk-and-dairy-products_en', 'https://trade.ec.europa.eu/access-to-markets/en/content/labelling-and-packaging', 'https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/', 'https://www.ftc.gov/', 'https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/commerce_clause', 'https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-CONAN-1992/pdf/GPO-CONAN-1992-10-15.pdf', 'https://constitution.congress.gov/resources/unconstitutional-laws/', 'https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-CONAN-1992/pdf/GPO-CONAN-1992-10-2.pdf', 'https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/08/11/2023-17041/regulations-to-implement-the-pregnant-workers-fairness-act', 'https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/291/502/', 'https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1214&context=facultyworkingpapers', 'https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/state-of-privacy-laws-in-us/', 'https://www.michigan.gov/-/media/Project/Websites/mde/Academic-Standards/Social_Studies_Standards.pdf?rev=7ec086ebb7814277baf6702705fb8007', 'https://www.congress.gov/bill/105th-congress/house-bill/4328', 'https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/commerce_clause', 'https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-CONAN-1992/pdf/GPO-CONAN-1992-10-15.pdf', 'https://constitution.congress.gov/resources/unconstitutional-laws/', 'https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-CONAN-1992/pdf/GPO-CONAN-1992-10-2.pdf', 'https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/08/11/2023-17041/regulations-to-implement-the-pregnant-workers-fairness-act', 'https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/291/502/', 'https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1214&context=facultyworkingpapers', 'https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/state-of-privacy-laws-in-us/', 'https://www.michigan.gov/-/media/Project/Websites/mde/Academic-Standards/Social_Studies_Standards.pdf?rev=7ec086ebb7814277baf6702705fb8007', 'https://www.congress.gov/bill/105th-congress/house-bill/4328', 'https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/commerce_clause', 'https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-CONAN-1992/pdf/GPO-CONAN-1992-10-15.pdf', 'https://constitution.congress.gov/resources/unconstitutional-laws/', 'https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-CONAN-1992/pdf/GPO-CONAN-1992-10-2.pdf', 'https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/08/11/2023-17041/regulations-to-implement-the-pregnant-workers-fairness-act', 'https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/291/502/', 'https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1214&context=facultyworkingpapers', 'https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/state-of-privacy-laws-in-us/', 'https://www.michigan.gov/-/media/Project/Websites/mde/Academic-Standards/Social_Studies_Standards.pdf?rev=7ec086ebb7814277baf6702705fb8007', 'https://www.congress.gov/bill/105th-congress/house-bill/4328']",politics
"Federalism is a mode of administration that combines a single political system of the central or ""federal"" government with regional governments (provincial, state, cantonal, territorial, or other subunit governments). Its distinguishing feature initially embodied in the innovative system of government established by the United States Constitution of 1789, is a parity relationship between the two tiers of government. It is thus characterized as a type of governance in which powers are split between two equal levels of authority.
Federalism is distinct from confederalism, in which the general level of government is subservient to the regional level, and devolution within a unitary state, in which the regional level of government is subordinate to the general level. It is the primary form in the pathway of regional integration or separation, restricted on one side by confederalism and on the other by devolution within a unitary state. India, United States, Malaysia, Brazil, Mexico, Germany, Russia, Canada, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Switzerland, Argentina, Belgium, Pakistan, Nigeria, and Australia are examples of federations or federal states. Some regard the European Union as a forerunner to federalism in a multi-state setting, a concept known as the federal union of states.
Federalism and India
Federalism in India refers to the relation between India's Central Government and its state governments. The Indian Constitution establishes the framework of the Indian government. Part XI of the Indian constitution stipulates the division of legislative, administrative, and executive functions between the union government and the Indian states. The legislative powers are split into three lists: the Union List, the State List, and the Concurrent List, which represent the powers conferred on the Union government, the State governments, and the powers shared among them.
This federalism is symmetrical in the sense that the delegated powers of the constituent entities are envisioned to be the same. Because of an intentionally temporary section of the Indian Constitution known as Article 370, the state of Jammu and Kashmir has historically been afforded a different status than other states (which was revoked by the Parliament in 2019). Union territories are unitary in nature, ruled directly by the Union administration. Article 1 (1) of the constitution provides for two levels of government, with an extra local elected government. Articles 239AA and 239A granted legislatures to Delhi and Puducherry, respectively.
The Parliament of India, a bicameral legislature comprising the Rajya Sabha and the Lok Sabha, wields legislative powers. The Rajya Sabha (or the 'Council of States') is the upper house of parliament, consisting of members appointed by the president and elected by state and territorial legislatures. The Lok Sabha (also known as the 'House of the People') is the lower house. Because its legislation is subject to judicial review by the Supreme Court, the parliament does not have complete control and sovereignty.
It does, however, have some influence over the executive. Members of the Council of Ministers, including the Prime Minister, are either appointed by parliament or elected within six months of taking office. The Lok Sabha holds the council as a whole accountable. The Lok Sabha is a transitory house that can be dissolved only if the ruling party loses the support of a majority of its members. The Rajya Sabha is an indefinite house that can never be dissolved. The Rajya Sabha members are elected for a six-year tenure.
The constitution defines the distribution of powers, and legislative powers are separated into three lists:
Union List: The Union List consists of 100 items (up from 97 before) on which the parliament has sole legislative authority. Defence, armed forces, arms and ammunition, atomic energy, foreign affairs, war and peace, citizenship, extradition, railways, shipping and navigation, airways, posts and telegraphs, telephones, wireless and broadcasting, currency, foreign trade, inter-state trade and commerce, banking, insurance, industry control, regulation, and development of mines, mineral, and oil resources are all included.
State List: There are 61 items on the State List (earlier 66 items). Maintaining law and order, police forces, healthcare, transportation, land policies, energy in the state, village administration, and so on are all topics where uniformity is desirable but not required. The state legislature has sole authority to enact legislation on these topics. The Rajya Sabha (Council of States) must pass a resolution with a two-thirds majority that it is expedient to act in the national interest in order for the parliament to create legislation on subjects listed in the State List in specific circumstances. Though states have sole legislative authority over items on the State List, articles 249, 250, 252, and 253 provide circumstances in which the Union government may legislate.","Can the Indian Federation survive without the consent of the states to amend the Constitution, especially in light of recent tensions between the Centre and some state governments?","The Indian Federation can survive without the consent of the states to amend the Constitution, but it would require a two-thirds majority in both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, as well as ratification by at least half of the state legislatures, as outlined in Article 368 of the Constitution.","['https://www.senate.gov/civics/constitution_item/constitution.htm', 'https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution-transcript', 'https://www.ncleg.gov/EnactedLegislation/Constitution/NCConstitution.html', 'https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/articles-of-confederation', 'https://www.congress.gov/help/learn-about-the-legislative-process/how-our-laws-are-made', 'https://www.leg.state.nv.us/const/nvconst.html', 'http://archive.government.ru/eng/gov/base/54.html', 'https://www.aclu.org/know-your-rights/immigrants-rights', 'https://japan.kantei.go.jp/constitution_and_government_of_japan/constitution_e.html', 'https://www.dps.nm.gov/law-enforcement-records-bureau/concealed-carry-licenses/', 'https://www.senate.gov/civics/constitution_item/constitution.htm', 'https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution-transcript', 'https://www.ncleg.gov/EnactedLegislation/Constitution/NCConstitution.html', 'https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/articles-of-confederation', 'https://www.congress.gov/help/learn-about-the-legislative-process/how-our-laws-are-made', 'https://www.leg.state.nv.us/const/nvconst.html', 'http://archive.government.ru/eng/gov/base/54.html', 'https://www.aclu.org/know-your-rights/immigrants-rights', 'https://japan.kantei.go.jp/constitution_and_government_of_japan/constitution_e.html', 'https://www.dps.nm.gov/law-enforcement-records-bureau/concealed-carry-licenses/', 'https://www.senate.gov/civics/constitution_item/constitution.htm', 'https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution-transcript', 'https://www.ncleg.gov/EnactedLegislation/Constitution/NCConstitution.html', 'https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/articles-of-confederation', 'https://www.congress.gov/help/learn-about-the-legislative-process/how-our-laws-are-made', 'https://www.leg.state.nv.us/const/nvconst.html', 'http://archive.government.ru/eng/gov/base/54.html', 'https://www.aclu.org/know-your-rights/immigrants-rights', 'https://japan.kantei.go.jp/constitution_and_government_of_japan/constitution_e.html', 'https://www.dps.nm.gov/law-enforcement-records-bureau/concealed-carry-licenses/']",politics

[E.g. 1) Pre-Independent India in the hands of UK. 2) Afghanistan, Iraq etc. in the hands of USA. 3) South East Asian countries in the hands of China]
Polarity: Bipolar world – Unipolar world – Multipolar world
- Depends on how many power centers or spheres of influence exit at a given point of time.
- Power center or sphere of influence: A powerful country rallies behind it a group of less powerful countries. All these countries come together based on a common ideology or/and common economic or/and strategic or/and political
|Distribution of power in which two states have the majority of economic, military, and cultural influence internationally or regionally.
|Distribution of power in which one state exercises most of the cultural, economic, and military influence.
|Distribution of power in which more than two nation-states have nearly equal amounts of military, cultural, and economic influence.
|The United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War era (1947-1990).
|The post-Cold War international system is unipolar with the United States being the sole power center of unmatched capabilities.
|Growth of China and India, weakening Russia and reduced American hegemony are all signs of the path to a new multipolar world. [Multipolarity is not yet achieved. The world at present is in a transition phase where power is shifting from west to east. (The balance of power is shifting from west to east)]
|Two distinct spheres of influence. [Western and capitalist states would fall under the influence of the USA. Communist states would fall under the influence of the USSR.]
|Only one distinct sphere of influence. Others are negligible or overshadowed by the most powerful one.
|More than two spheres of influence. [spheres of influence are not as rigid as in the case of unipolar and bipolar world]

[Hegemonic stability theory]
- Hegemonic stability theory: Powerful states foster international orders that are stable. [No competition = no war]
- The Balance of power theory: as long as the international system remains in balance [(mostly multipolar world)(without unipolar power)], peace is maintained.
- Regionalism in International relations: The theory or practice of forming regional groups rather than going with a central system/systems of administration. [Pacific Rim countries initiated a regional trade group called as TPP – Trans-Pacific Partnership. TPP is seen as a regional rival/alternative to WTO (WTO has become too rigid with its trade negotiation rounds inconclusive and chaotic).]","Can the increasing influence of regional powers in multilateral forums lead to a destabilization of the global order, and if so, what measures can be taken to mitigate this risk?","The increasing influence of regional powers in multilateral forums can indeed lead to a destabilization of the global order, as it can create new power dynamics and challenges to the existing international system. To mitigate this risk, measures can be taken to promote greater strategic stability, such as reducing the risk of conflict through diplomacy and dialogue, increasing cooperation among nations, and addressing the root causes of fragility and instability. Additionally, global powers can work together to address shared challenges and promote a more inclusive and equitable global order.","['https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/ATA-2023-Unclassified-Report.pdf', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Biden-Harris-Administrations-National-Security-Strategy-10.2022.pdf', 'https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/GlobalTrends_2040.pdf', 'https://www.international.gc.ca/transparency-transparence/indo-pacific-indo-pacifique/index.aspx?lang=eng', 'https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-long-game-chinas-grand-strategy-to-displace-american-order/', 'https://www.mfa.gov.cn/eng/wjbxw/202206/t20220619_10706059.html', 'https://www.state.gov/united-states-strategy-to-prevent-conflict-and-promote-stability/', 'https://carnegieendowment.org/2023/06/28/un-security-council-reform-what-world-thinks-pub-90032', 'https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Global_Risks_Report_2023.pdf', 'https://carnegieendowment.org/publications/?fa=57044', 'https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/ATA-2023-Unclassified-Report.pdf', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Biden-Harris-Administrations-National-Security-Strategy-10.2022.pdf', 'https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/GlobalTrends_2040.pdf', 'https://www.international.gc.ca/transparency-transparence/indo-pacific-indo-pacifique/index.aspx?lang=eng', 'https://www.state.gov/united-states-strategy-to-prevent-conflict-and-promote-stability/', 'https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Global_Risks_Report_2023.pdf', 'https://press.un.org/en/2023/sc15318.doc.htm', 'https://www.mfa.gov.cn/eng/wjbxw/202206/t20220619_10706059.html', 'https://carnegieendowment.org/2023/06/28/un-security-council-reform-what-world-thinks-pub-90032', 'https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-long-game-chinas-grand-strategy-to-displace-american-order/', 'https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/ATA-2023-Unclassified-Report.pdf', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Biden-Harris-Administrations-National-Security-Strategy-10.2022.pdf', 'https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/GlobalTrends_2040.pdf', 'https://www.international.gc.ca/transparency-transparence/indo-pacific-indo-pacifique/index.aspx?lang=eng', 'https://www.state.gov/united-states-strategy-to-prevent-conflict-and-promote-stability/', 'https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Global_Risks_Report_2023.pdf', 'https://press.un.org/en/2023/sc15318.doc.htm', 'https://www.mfa.gov.cn/eng/wjbxw/202206/t20220619_10706059.html', 'https://carnegieendowment.org/2023/06/28/un-security-council-reform-what-world-thinks-pub-90032', 'https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-long-game-chinas-grand-strategy-to-displace-american-order/']",politics

This development could be attributed to the growing assertiveness of major powers, such as the United States, China, and Russia, which are increasingly using their veto powers to block actions and pursue their own national interests.

The observation suggests that major powers are using their control over international organizations to coerce other countries into serving their political and economic strategies, which could lead to a decline in international cooperation and governance. Additionally, the increasing trend of unilateral actions could lead to a fragmentation of the international system, with different powers pursuing their own agendas and interests.

The search results also highlight the importance of international organizations in maintaining international peace and security, and the need for joint action among major powers to address global challenges. However, the increasing trend of unilateral actions could undermine the effectiveness of these organizations and hinder the ability of major powers to work together to address global challenges.

In conclusion, the increasing trend of unilateral actions by major powers could have significant implications for the future of international cooperation and governance. It is essential for major powers to work together to address global challenges and maintain international peace and security, and for international organizations to adapt to the changing global landscape and maintain their effectiveness in addressing global challenges.","['https://press.un.org/en/2023/sc15263.doc.htm', 'https://www.cfr.org/china-global-governance/', 'https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjbxw/202302/t20230220_11027664.html', 'https://www.jstor.org/stable/174551', 'https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/nsc/nssall.html', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Biden-Harris-Administrations-National-Security-Strategy-10.2022.pdf', 'https://treaties.un.org/Pages/Overview.aspx?path=overview/glossary/page1_en.xml', 'https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-congress-the-yalta-conference', 'https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/GlobalTrends_2040.pdf', 'https://carnegieendowment.org/2023/01/23/four-contending-u.s.-approaches-to-multilateralism-pub-88852', 'https://press.un.org/en/2023/sc15263.doc.htm', 'https://www.cfr.org/china-global-governance/', 'https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjbxw/202302/t20230220_11027664.html', 'https://www.jstor.org/stable/174551', 'https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/nsc/nssall.html', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Biden-Harris-Administrations-National-Security-Strategy-10.2022.pdf', 'https://treaties.un.org/Pages/Overview.aspx?path=overview/glossary/page1_en.xml', 'https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-congress-the-yalta-conference', 'https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/GlobalTrends_2040.pdf', 'https://carnegieendowment.org/2023/01/23/four-contending-u.s.-approaches-to-multilateralism-pub-88852', 'https://press.un.org/en/2023/sc15263.doc.htm', 'https://www.cfr.org/china-global-governance/', 'https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjbxw/202302/t20230220_11027664.html', 'https://www.jstor.org/stable/174551', 'https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/nsc/nssall.html', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Biden-Harris-Administrations-National-Security-Strategy-10.2022.pdf', 'https://treaties.un.org/Pages/Overview.aspx?path=overview/glossary/page1_en.xml', 'https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-congress-the-yalta-conference', 'https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/GlobalTrends_2040.pdf', 'https://carnegieendowment.org/2023/01/23/four-contending-u.s.-approaches-to-multilateralism-pub-88852']",politics

The unilateral use of military power can create a perception that a country is prioritizing its own interests over those of the region and the global community, leading to a decrease in trust and cooperation. This can be seen in the search results, where many sources highlight the importance of regional powers working together to manage ongoing conflicts and define norms for regional stability.

The reliance on military might can also lead to a lack of investment in diplomatic efforts and regional organizations, which can further erode trust and cooperation. For example, the search results mention that the Middle East and North Africa have been ""riddled with political interference, military intervention and regime subversion,"" which can create an environment where regional powers are more likely to prioritize their own interests over those of the global community.

Furthermore, the unilateral use of military power can also have unintended consequences, such as creating a power vacuum that can be exploited by other regional powers or non-state actors. This can lead to a destabilization of the region and a decrease in global security.

2. Standardized protocols: Establishing standardized protocols for disaster response can help streamline decision-making and reduce the likelihood of delays.
3. Training and exercises: Conducting regular training exercises and drills can help identify and address potential bottlenecks in disaster response efforts.
4. Collaboration and coordination: Encouraging collaboration and coordination among different government agencies, emergency responders, and other stakeholders can help ensure a more effective response.
5. Funding and resources: Providing adequate funding and resources to support disaster response efforts can help ensure that necessary measures are taken to mitigate the effects of administrative inertia.
6. Public awareness and education: Educating the public on disaster preparedness and response can help reduce the impact of administrative inertia by encouraging individuals to take proactive steps to prepare for and respond to disasters.

The Union and the States each have their own executive staffs, which are supervised by their respective governments. Except when the presidential rule is imposed in a state, the union government cannot overrule the state government's constitutional rights and powers in legislative and administrative matters. The Union's responsibility is to ensure that each State's government operates in compliance with the Constitution's provisions, as outlined in Articles 355 and 256. In administrative concerns, state governments are not allowed to break federal legislation. When a state violates the Constitution, Presidential rule can be imposed under Article 356 and the President can take over the administration of the state with the Parliament's ex post facto assent under Article 357.
Federal Characteristics of Indian Constitution
The “Separation of Powers” idea is observed by these types of governments. India operates on the premise of a two-tiered government, with the central government and state governments sharing power. The Indian constitution, which envisions a parliamentary system of government, is federal in structure and unitary in nature. The three main branches of the federal government are the legislative, executive, and judicial.
The constitutional law comprises both legal in the strict sense and usages, generally referred to as conventions, which are acknowledged as binding by all those involved in government even if they are not enacted. Many regulations and practices aren't part of the law in the sense that breaking them can result in legal action.
The Indian Constitution is regarded to be a federal structure since it provides clear demarcation of boundaries between the central and state governments, similar to that of the United States. India's legislative and executive powers are shared between the centre and the states.
Let us describe the main features of Indian federal system.
Dual Polity: The Constitution creates a dual polity with the Union at the centre and the states at the periphery. Each is endowed with sovereign powers to be exercised in the different fields entrusted to them by the Constitution. The Union government is in charge of subjects of national importance such as defence, foreign affairs, currency, and communication, among others. State governments, on the other hand, are in charge of regional and local issues such as public order, agriculture, health, and local governance.
Written Constitution: The Constitution is not only a written document, but it is also the world's longest. It began with a Preamble, 395 Articles (split into 22 Parts), and 8 Schedules. At the time of writing (2013), it consists of a Preamble, approximately 465 Articles (split into 25 Parts), and 12 Schedules. It defines the structure, organization, powers, and functions of the federal and state governments, as well as the boundaries within which they must work. As a result, misunderstandings and arguments between the two are avoided.
Division of Powers: In the Seventh Schedule, the Constitution divided powers between the Centre and the states using the Union List, State List, and Concurrent List. The Union List is made up of 100 subjects (originally 97), the State List is made up of 61 subjects (originally 66), and the Concurrent List is made up of 52 subjects (originally 47). The Centre and the states can both pass legislation on the subjects on the concurrent list, but in the event of a conflict, the Central law takes precedence. The Centre receives residuary topics (those that are not specified in any of the three lists).
Constitutional Supremacy: The Constitution is the highest (or supreme) law of the land. The laws passed by the Centre and the states must be consistent with its provisions. Otherwise, they can be ruled null and void by the Supreme Court or the High Court using their judicial review powers. As a result, the institutions of government (legislative, executive, and judiciary) at both levels must work within the boundaries established by the Constitution.","What would happen to the functioning of a state government if the President, in exercise of his powers under Article 356, were to assume control over the administration of the state without obtaining the prior consent of the Parliament?",The assumption of control over the administration of a state by the President without prior consent of Parliament would have significant implications for the functioning of the state government.,"['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President%27s_rule', 'https://legalaffairs.gov.in/sites/default/files/Article%20356%20of%20the%20Constitution.pdf', 'https://www.mercatus.org/students/research/journal-articles/presidents-rule-india-state-emergency-or-political-capture', 'https://indiankanoon.org/doc/8019/', 'https://byjus.com/free-ias-prep/article-356/', 'https://www.nextias.com/blog/president-rule/', 'https://ujala.uk.gov.in/files/ch11_1.pdf', 'https://www.jstor.org/stable/43952424', 'https://www.india.gov.in/my-government/constitution-india/amendments/constitution-india-sixty-eighth-amendment-act-1991', 'https://main.sci.gov.in/pdf/LU/article_370.pdf', 'https://www.nextias.com/blog/president-rule/', 'https://www.senate.gov/civics/constitution_item/constitution.htm', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/11/30/memorandum-on-uniform-standards-for-tribal-consultation/', 'https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/constitutional.aspx', 'https://www.pmindia.gov.in/en/news_updates/cabinet-approves-extension-of-presidents-rule-in-jk-for-six-months-with-effect-from-3rd-july-2019/', 'https://harvardlawreview.org/print/vol-134/from-domicile-to-dominion-indias-settler-colonial-agenda-in-kashmir/', 'https://www.usa.gov/branches-of-government', 'https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/archives/speech/farewell-address-nation', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._R._Bommai_v._Union_of_India', 'https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/list', 'https://www.nextias.com/blog/president-rule/', 'https://www.senate.gov/civics/constitution_item/constitution.htm', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/11/30/memorandum-on-uniform-standards-for-tribal-consultation/', 'https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/constitutional.aspx', 'https://www.pmindia.gov.in/en/news_updates/cabinet-approves-extension-of-presidents-rule-in-jk-for-six-months-with-effect-from-3rd-july-2019/', 'https://harvardlawreview.org/print/vol-134/from-domicile-to-dominion-indias-settler-colonial-agenda-in-kashmir/', 'https://www.usa.gov/branches-of-government', 'https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/archives/speech/farewell-address-nation', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._R._Bommai_v._Union_of_India', 'https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/list']",politics

Firstly, it could be argued that the decision violates the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment, which prohibits states from denying any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. The Supreme Court has consistently held that gender-based classifications are subject to strict scrutiny, meaning that they must be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest.

Secondly, the decision could be challenged under the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment, which guarantees that all persons receive due process of law. The Supreme Court has held that affirmative action programs, including those that reserve seats for women, must be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest and must not unduly burden the rights of individuals.

Thirdly, the decision could be challenged under the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection under the law. The Supreme Court has held that gender-based classifications are subject to strict scrutiny, and that any such classification must be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest.

Finally, the decision could be challenged under the principles of federalism, which hold that the powers of the federal government are limited to those specifically granted by the Constitution, and that the states have the power to regulate their own affairs. The Supreme Court has held that the states have the power to regulate their own universities and to make their own decisions about admissions policies.

In conclusion, the decision to reserve 50% of the seats in a state-run university for women can be challenged in the Supreme Court on several grounds, including the Equal Protection Clause, the Due Process Clause, the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection under the law, and the principles of federalism.","['https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/section-15-race-and-color-discrimination', 'https://cawp.rutgers.edu/facts/milestones-women-american-politics', 'https://oag.ca.gov/sites/all/files/agweb/pdfs/consumers/disabled_bookmarks.pdf', 'https://cawp.rutgers.edu/facts/current-numbers', 'https://www.justice.gov/crt/title-52-voting-and-elections-subtitle-i-and-ii', 'https://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Documents/Government_Misconduct_and_Convicting_the_Innocent.pdf', 'https://constitution.congress.gov/resources/unconstitutional-laws/', 'https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/20-1199_hgdj.pdf', 'https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/GlobalTrends_2040.pdf', 'https://www.npr.org/2023/06/29/1181138066/affirmative-action-supreme-court-decision', 'https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/section-15-race-and-color-discrimination', 'https://cawp.rutgers.edu/facts/milestones-women-american-politics', 'https://oag.ca.gov/sites/all/files/agweb/pdfs/consumers/disabled_bookmarks.pdf', 'https://cawp.rutgers.edu/facts/current-numbers', 'https://www.justice.gov/crt/title-52-voting-and-elections-subtitle-i-and-ii', 'https://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Documents/Government_Misconduct_and_Convicting_the_Innocent.pdf', 'https://constitution.congress.gov/resources/unconstitutional-laws/', 'https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/20-1199_hgdj.pdf', 'https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/GlobalTrends_2040.pdf', 'https://www.npr.org/2023/06/29/1181138066/affirmative-action-supreme-court-decision', 'https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/section-15-race-and-color-discrimination', 'https://cawp.rutgers.edu/facts/milestones-women-american-politics', 'https://oag.ca.gov/sites/all/files/agweb/pdfs/consumers/disabled_bookmarks.pdf', 'https://cawp.rutgers.edu/facts/current-numbers', 'https://www.justice.gov/crt/title-52-voting-and-elections-subtitle-i-and-ii', 'https://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Documents/Government_Misconduct_and_Convicting_the_Innocent.pdf', 'https://constitution.congress.gov/resources/unconstitutional-laws/', 'https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/20-1199_hgdj.pdf', 'https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/GlobalTrends_2040.pdf', 'https://www.npr.org/2023/06/29/1181138066/affirmative-action-supreme-court-decision']",politics

Federal Characteristics of Indian Constitution
The “Separation of Powers” idea is observed by these types of governments. India operates on the premise of a two-tiered government, with the central government and state governments sharing power. The Indian constitution, which envisions a parliamentary system of government, is federal in structure and unitary in nature. The three main branches of the federal government are the legislative, executive, and judicial.
The constitutional law comprises both legal in the strict sense and usages, generally referred to as conventions, which are acknowledged as binding by all those involved in government even if they are not enacted. Many regulations and practices aren't part of the law in the sense that breaking them can result in legal action.
The Indian Constitution is regarded to be a federal structure since it provides clear demarcation of boundaries between the central and state governments, similar to that of the United States. India's legislative and executive powers are shared between the centre and the states.
Let us describe the main features of Indian federal system.
Dual Polity: The Constitution creates a dual polity with the Union at the centre and the states at the periphery. Each is endowed with sovereign powers to be exercised in the different fields entrusted to them by the Constitution. The Union government is in charge of subjects of national importance such as defence, foreign affairs, currency, and communication, among others. State governments, on the other hand, are in charge of regional and local issues such as public order, agriculture, health, and local governance.
Written Constitution: The Constitution is not only a written document, but it is also the world's longest. It began with a Preamble, 395 Articles (split into 22 Parts), and 8 Schedules. At the time of writing (2013), it consists of a Preamble, approximately 465 Articles (split into 25 Parts), and 12 Schedules. It defines the structure, organization, powers, and functions of the federal and state governments, as well as the boundaries within which they must work. As a result, misunderstandings and arguments between the two are avoided.
Division of Powers: In the Seventh Schedule, the Constitution divided powers between the Centre and the states using the Union List, State List, and Concurrent List. The Union List is made up of 100 subjects (originally 97), the State List is made up of 61 subjects (originally 66), and the Concurrent List is made up of 52 subjects (originally 47). The Centre and the states can both pass legislation on the subjects on the concurrent list, but in the event of a conflict, the Central law takes precedence. The Centre receives residuary topics (those that are not specified in any of the three lists).
Constitutional Supremacy: The Constitution is the highest (or supreme) law of the land. The laws passed by the Centre and the states must be consistent with its provisions. Otherwise, they can be ruled null and void by the Supreme Court or the High Court using their judicial review powers. As a result, the institutions of government (legislative, executive, and judiciary) at both levels must work within the boundaries established by the Constitution.","Can the Supreme Court overturn a parliamentary decision that contradicts the spirit of federalism, and if so, what would be the implications on the balance of power between the centre and the states?","The Supreme Court's ability to overturn a parliamentary decision that contradicts the spirit of federalism is a complex issue, and there are multiple perspectives on this topic.

One perspective is that the Supreme Court has the power to review and overturn parliamentary decisions that violate the Constitution or federal laws. This is based on the principle of judicial review, which is enshrined in the Constitution. According to this view, the Supreme Court has the authority to ensure that parliamentary decisions are consistent with the Constitution and federal laws, and to strike down those that are not.

Another perspective is that the Supreme Court should not overturn parliamentary decisions that contradict the spirit of federalism, as this would undermine the democratic process and the authority of the elected branches of government. This view argues that the Supreme Court should focus on interpreting the Constitution and federal laws, rather than making policy decisions that are the purview of the elected branches.

A third perspective is that the Supreme Court's power to overturn parliamentary decisions is limited by the principle of separation of powers. According to this view, the Supreme Court should not interfere with the decisions of the elected branches of government, as this would blur the lines between the judicial and legislative branches and undermine the system of checks and balances.

In conclusion, the Supreme Court's ability to overturn a parliamentary decision that contradicts the spirit of federalism is a complex issue that is subject to multiple perspectives. While the Supreme Court has the power to review and overturn parliamentary decisions, it is also important to consider the principles of separation of powers and the democratic process in evaluating the Court's role in this context.","['https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/constitutional.aspx', 'https://guides.loc.gov/federalist-papers/text-81-85', 'https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/20-843_7j80.pdf', 'https://constitutioncenter.org/the-constitution/historic-document-library/detail/alexander-hamilton-federalist-no-78-1788', 'https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/mcculloch-v-maryland', 'https://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/csj-sjc/rfc-dlc/ccrf-ccdl/check/art521.html', 'https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/The-Presidents-Advisory-1776-Commission-Final-Report.pdf', 'https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/384/436/', 'https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-CONAN-1992/pdf/GPO-CONAN-1992-10-2.pdf', 'https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/R45129.html', 'https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/constitutional.aspx', 'https://guides.loc.gov/federalist-papers/text-81-85', 'https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/20-843_7j80.pdf', 'https://constitutioncenter.org/the-constitution/historic-document-library/detail/alexander-hamilton-federalist-no-78-1788', 'https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/mcculloch-v-maryland', 'https://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/csj-sjc/rfc-dlc/ccrf-ccdl/check/art521.html', 'https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/The-Presidents-Advisory-1776-Commission-Final-Report.pdf', 'https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/384/436/', 'https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-CONAN-1992/pdf/GPO-CONAN-1992-10-2.pdf', 'https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/R45129.html', 'https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/constitutional.aspx', 'https://guides.loc.gov/federalist-papers/text-81-85', 'https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/20-843_7j80.pdf', 'https://constitutioncenter.org/the-constitution/historic-document-library/detail/alexander-hamilton-federalist-no-78-1788', 'https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/mcculloch-v-maryland', 'https://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/csj-sjc/rfc-dlc/ccrf-ccdl/check/art521.html', 'https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/The-Presidents-Advisory-1776-Commission-Final-Report.pdf', 'https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/384/436/', 'https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-CONAN-1992/pdf/GPO-CONAN-1992-10-2.pdf', 'https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/R45129.html']",politics

1. The Constitution (Seventy-fourth Amendment) Act, 1992, which provides for the creation of the legislative council in the states, ensures that the council has a role in the lawmaking process.
2. The Constitution (Ninety-first Amendment) Act, 2003, which provides for the creation of the Rajya Sabha, ensures that the upper house of the parliament has a role in the lawmaking process.
3. The Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment) Act, 2016, which provides for the creation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council, ensures that the council has a role in the lawmaking process related to GST.
4. The Constitution (One Hundred and Second Amendment) Act, 2017, which provides for the creation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council, ensures that the council has a role in the lawmaking process related to GST.

"With the current state of COVID-19, primary elections have been delayed, postponed, altered, and adjusted. No one knows for sure what will happen with even the presidential election, set in November of this year. Compared to the 2016 presidential election between Hilary Clinton and Donald Trump, the media seemed to exclusively focus on politics, but this year’s election coverage seems to be quite low. In this current time of relatively lessened political activity, perhaps now is the time to take a short break and look back at how politics first originated.
The basic foundations of Western politics were first developed by the Socratic political philosophers in Greece and further sharpened by the Ancient Romans. Although the political history of Greece and Rome ended long ago, the effects it has on modern culture are colossal as the theologies that were introduced still affect societies today.
During the ancient Greek times, four main political ideologies: democracy, monarchy, oligarchy, and tyranny were either developed or refined. The principles of democracy originated and developed in the city of Athens. Any male citizen who was at least 18 years old and had the ability to speak had the right to vote in governmental issues. Democracy at this level was unprecedented. The idea of monarchy and tyranny had existed before the Ancient Greek times but was further defined by the Greeks. The main difference between monarchs and tyrants was that monarchs were dictators who worked for the good of people while tyrants were dictators who worked for their own benefit. Oligarchy also developed during this time and is very close to representative democracy as it is when a small group of people run a state. Overall, within the political history of Greece, very different and distinct political systems coexisted and advanced together.
The next significant development in the history of politics occurred in the Ancient Roman Civilization. Unlike the political history of Greece, the political history of Rome is more of a timeline of stories rather than a comparison of different political ideals that were developed. Rome went through two major political changes before its fall. Rome was first established as the Roman kingdom, in which a monarch ruled. They soon developed into the Roman republic, in which the Senate held onto the central political authority. Finally, the republic evolved into the Roman Empire, in which an emperor ruled.
The Roman Kingdom is the earliest period of Ancient Rome. The monarchy settled in following the establishment of Ancient Rome. During this time, the monarchy had all central authority and power was in the hands of the king. The Senate had already been formed under the first king, Romulus, but it was more like an advisory group of nobles for the King. Eventually though, the Roman Kingdom would come to a stop as the seventh king of Rome, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, got involved in a series of scandals including use of violence and intimidation to showcase power, disrespecting the Senate, and having his son get into a serious scandal with a noble’s daughter. The King of Rome was overthrown and the monarchy was replaced with a republic.
During the time of the Roman Republic, politics greatly developed. The Senate evolved from being an advisory council to becoming the ultimate authority in Rome. The common people of Rome would elect two consuls (the senate’s leading chair) and the consuls would then appoint the senators. These senators would then run all the governmental work and vote to pass legislation and treaties. The Roman Republic has a lasting effect on the world. For example, foundations of American politics were borrowed from the Roman political system. Eventually though, Augustus, a Roman statesman and general, would take control of the Republic in 27 BC and the Roman Republic was replaced by the Roman Empire.
During the time of the Roman Empire, the power was in the hands of the emperor of Rome. Despite being mostly an authoritarian dictatorship on the inside, the imperial rulers tried to display the government as constitutional, distorting the senate to benefit the emperor. For example, the Praetorian Guard was formed, and this gave military power to Roman emperors as troops weren’t previously allowed in the capital city. Overall, during the time of the Roman Empire, the central emperor would hold all the governmental power and the common people had much less power.","What are some possible reasons why, in modern times, politicians may be more likely to abuse their power if they sense a lack of public scrutiny and accountability, and how does this relate to the ancient Greek concept of tyranny?","The concept of tyranny in ancient Greece refers to the abuse of power by a ruler or government, often characterized by a lack of accountability and disregard for the well-being of the people.

"With the current state of COVID-19, primary elections have been delayed, postponed, altered, and adjusted. No one knows for sure what will happen with even the presidential election, set in November of this year. Compared to the 2016 presidential election between Hilary Clinton and Donald Trump, the media seemed to exclusively focus on politics, but this year’s election coverage seems to be quite low. In this current time of relatively lessened political activity, perhaps now is the time to take a short break and look back at how politics first originated.
The basic foundations of Western politics were first developed by the Socratic political philosophers in Greece and further sharpened by the Ancient Romans. Although the political history of Greece and Rome ended long ago, the effects it has on modern culture are colossal as the theologies that were introduced still affect societies today.
During the ancient Greek times, four main political ideologies: democracy, monarchy, oligarchy, and tyranny were either developed or refined. The principles of democracy originated and developed in the city of Athens. Any male citizen who was at least 18 years old and had the ability to speak had the right to vote in governmental issues. Democracy at this level was unprecedented. The idea of monarchy and tyranny had existed before the Ancient Greek times but was further defined by the Greeks. The main difference between monarchs and tyrants was that monarchs were dictators who worked for the good of people while tyrants were dictators who worked for their own benefit. Oligarchy also developed during this time and is very close to representative democracy as it is when a small group of people run a state. Overall, within the political history of Greece, very different and distinct political systems coexisted and advanced together.
The next significant development in the history of politics occurred in the Ancient Roman Civilization. Unlike the political history of Greece, the political history of Rome is more of a timeline of stories rather than a comparison of different political ideals that were developed. Rome went through two major political changes before its fall. Rome was first established as the Roman kingdom, in which a monarch ruled. They soon developed into the Roman republic, in which the Senate held onto the central political authority. Finally, the republic evolved into the Roman Empire, in which an emperor ruled.
The Roman Kingdom is the earliest period of Ancient Rome. The monarchy settled in following the establishment of Ancient Rome. During this time, the monarchy had all central authority and power was in the hands of the king. The Senate had already been formed under the first king, Romulus, but it was more like an advisory group of nobles for the King. Eventually though, the Roman Kingdom would come to a stop as the seventh king of Rome, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, got involved in a series of scandals including use of violence and intimidation to showcase power, disrespecting the Senate, and having his son get into a serious scandal with a noble’s daughter.

The construction of the Parthenon was a symbol of Athenian power and wealth, and it was built to honor the goddess Athena, who was the patron deity of the city. The temple's design and construction were also influenced by the cultural and artistic values of the time, as well as the political and social dynamics of ancient Athens.

The Parthenon was built during the Golden Age of Athens, a period of great cultural and artistic achievement. The temple's design was influenced by the principles of harmony and balance, and its construction was a testament to the skill and craftsmanship of the ancient Greeks. The Parthenon was also a symbol of Athenian democracy, as it was built with funds provided by the Athenian state and was intended to be a public building that would be used by the citizens of Athens.

The construction of the Parthenon was also motivated by a desire to surpass the architectural achievements of other ancient Greek cities. The temple's design and construction were intended to be a reflection of Athenian power and prestige, and it was built to be a symbol of the city's cultural and artistic achievements.

In conclusion, the primary motivator behind the construction of the Temple of Athena on the Acropolis was a complex interplay of factors, including the values and power dynamics of ancient Athens, the cultural and artistic values of the time, and the political and social dynamics of the city. The Parthenon was a symbol of Athenian power and wealth, and it was built to honor the goddess Athena, who was the patron deity of the city.","['https://www.reed.edu/humanities/110Tech/Parthenon.html', 'https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/parthenon/hurwit.html', 'https://www.history.com/news/parthenon-acropolis-ancient-greece-engineering', 'https://www.britannica.com/question/What-is-the-purpose-of-the-Parthenon', 'https://www.quora.com/What-is-Anton-Chigurh-s-primary-motivation', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/1dpi6fh/gf_broke_up_with_me_so_i_got_high_and_built_this/', 'https://www.quora.com/What-is-was-your-major-motivation-for-pursuing-civil-engineering', 'https://www.worldhistory.org/article/214/alexander-the-great--the-burning-of-persepolis/', 'https://ancientart.as.ua.edu/the-parthenon-athena-and-the-ideal-greek/', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/camphalfblood/comments/xnzy0y/my_many_problems_with_annabeth_chase_general/', 'https://mascontext.com/issues/repetition/building-repetition-through-history-motivations-and-implications', 'https://www.theartnewspaper.com/2002/12/01/a-short-history-of-the-parthenon-marbles-why-restitution-is-not-always-the-answer', 'https://www.history.com/news/parthenon-acropolis-ancient-greece-engineering', 'https://ancientart.as.ua.edu/the-parthenon-athena-and-the-ideal-greek/', 'https://jessicalippe.com/2016/03/15/a-tale-of-two-parthenons/', 'https://hyperallergic.com/741793/protesters-urge-british-museum-to-return-the-parthenon-marbles/', 'https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-irregularities-found-in-the-construction-of-the-Parthenon-and-the-intentions-behind-these', 'https://www.britannica.com/question/What-is-the-purpose-of-the-Parthenon', 'https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/parthenon/hurwit.html', 'https://www.reed.edu/humanities/110Tech/Parthenon.html']",politics

This concentration of power could have led to the emergence of strong leaders who exploited the democratic system to gain control and maintain their power.

One perspective is that the Athenian democracy's emphasis on popular opinion and majority rule created an environment where demagogues and charismatic leaders could rise to power by appealing to the masses. This could have led to the emergence of tyrants who used their popularity to justify their authoritarian rule.

Another perspective is that the Athenian democracy's lack of institutional checks and balances created an environment where power was not effectively distributed or limited. This could have led to the concentration of power in the hands of a few individuals, who could then use their power to establish tyrannical regimes.

Additionally, the Athenian democracy's emphasis on direct democracy and citizen participation may have created an environment where citizens were more likely to support strong leaders who promised to deliver benefits and protection. This could have led to the emergence of tyrants who used their popularity to justify their authoritarian rule.

Democracy at this level was unprecedented. The idea of monarchy and tyranny had existed before the Ancient Greek times but was further defined by the Greeks. The main difference between monarchs and tyrants was that monarchs were dictators who worked for the good of people while tyrants were dictators who worked for their own benefit. Oligarchy also developed during this time and is very close to representative democracy as it is when a small group of people run a state. Overall, within the political history of Greece, very different and distinct political systems coexisted and advanced together.
The next significant development in the history of politics occurred in the Ancient Roman Civilization. Unlike the political history of Greece, the political history of Rome is more of a timeline of stories rather than a comparison of different political ideals that were developed. Rome went through two major political changes before its fall. Rome was first established as the Roman kingdom, in which a monarch ruled. They soon developed into the Roman republic, in which the Senate held onto the central political authority. Finally, the republic evolved into the Roman Empire, in which an emperor ruled.
The Roman Kingdom is the earliest period of Ancient Rome. The monarchy settled in following the establishment of Ancient Rome. During this time, the monarchy had all central authority and power was in the hands of the king. The Senate had already been formed under the first king, Romulus, but it was more like an advisory group of nobles for the King. Eventually though, the Roman Kingdom would come to a stop as the seventh king of Rome, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, got involved in a series of scandals including use of violence and intimidation to showcase power, disrespecting the Senate, and having his son get into a serious scandal with a noble’s daughter. The King of Rome was overthrown and the monarchy was replaced with a republic.
During the time of the Roman Republic, politics greatly developed. The Senate evolved from being an advisory council to becoming the ultimate authority in Rome. The common people of Rome would elect two consuls (the senate’s leading chair) and the consuls would then appoint the senators. These senators would then run all the governmental work and vote to pass legislation and treaties. The Roman Republic has a lasting effect on the world. For example, foundations of American politics were borrowed from the Roman political system. Eventually though, Augustus, a Roman statesman and general, would take control of the Republic in 27 BC and the Roman Republic was replaced by the Roman Empire.
During the time of the Roman Empire, the power was in the hands of the emperor of Rome. Despite being mostly an authoritarian dictatorship on the inside, the imperial rulers tried to display the government as constitutional, distorting the senate to benefit the emperor. For example, the Praetorian Guard was formed, and this gave military power to Roman emperors as troops weren’t previously allowed in the capital city. Overall, during the time of the Roman Empire, the central emperor would hold all the governmental power and the common people had much less power.","How do the electoral systems and parliamentary structures of modern-day European democracies reflect the influence of ancient Greek democratic principles, despite the fact that many of these countries were once ruled by monarchies or authoritarian regimes?","The influence of ancient Greek democratic principles on modern-day European democracies is a complex and multifaceted topic, with various perspectives and historical developments shaping the current systems and structures.","['https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/fyg3ro/are_we_giving_ancient_greece_too_much_credit_for/', 'https://www.nationalgeographic.org/article/greek-influence-us-democracy/', 'https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2021/653635/EXPO_STU(2021)653635_EN.pdf', 'https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/declassified_139339.htm', 'https://carnegieendowment.org/2018/06/21/comparing-democratic-distress-in-united-states-and-europe-pub-76646', 'https://www.coe.int/en/web/compass/democracy', 'https://www.cde.ca.gov/be/st/ss/documents/histsocscistnd.pdf', 'https://www.history.com/topics/ancient-greece/ancient-greece-democracy', 'https://www.lamoncloa.gob.es/lang/en/espana/historyandculture/history/Paginas/index.aspx', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_democracy', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/fyg3ro/are_we_giving_ancient_greece_too_much_credit_for/', 'https://www.nationalgeographic.org/article/greek-influence-us-democracy/', 'https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2021/653635/EXPO_STU(2021)653635_EN.pdf', 'https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/declassified_139339.htm', 'https://carnegieendowment.org/2018/06/21/comparing-democratic-distress-in-united-states-and-europe-pub-76646', 'https://www.coe.int/en/web/compass/democracy', 'https://www.cde.ca.gov/be/st/ss/documents/histsocscistnd.pdf', 'https://www.history.com/topics/ancient-greece/ancient-greece-democracy', 'https://www.lamoncloa.gob.es/lang/en/espana/historyandculture/history/Paginas/index.aspx', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_democracy', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/fyg3ro/are_we_giving_ancient_greece_too_much_credit_for/', 'https://www.nationalgeographic.org/article/greek-influence-us-democracy/', 'https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2021/653635/EXPO_STU(2021)653635_EN.pdf', 'https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/declassified_139339.htm', 'https://carnegieendowment.org/2018/06/21/comparing-democratic-distress-in-united-states-and-europe-pub-76646', 'https://www.coe.int/en/web/compass/democracy', 'https://www.cde.ca.gov/be/st/ss/documents/histsocscistnd.pdf', 'https://www.history.com/topics/ancient-greece/ancient-greece-democracy', 'https://www.lamoncloa.gob.es/lang/en/espana/historyandculture/history/Paginas/index.aspx', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_democracy']",politics
"If politicians genuinely respected “the people’s will”, they would let us express it between elections.
By George Monbiot, published in the Guardian 24th October 2019
They promised sovereignty, but at first it was unclear which variety of sovereignty they meant. Were the politicians who swore we would regain it when we left the European Union referring to parliamentary sovereignty or popular sovereignty? Now we know they didn’t mean parliamentary sovereignty. Boris Johnson’s government has sought to trick, rush, ignore and prorogue Parliament at every turn.
“People v Parliament” is his pitch to the nation. So where do the people come in? If Johnson is a champion of popular sovereignty, why does he propose no improvements to a 19th Century model of democracy, that permits no popular engagement other than an election every few years, and a referendum every few decades?
There is a tension between parliamentary and popular sovereignty. A lively, meaningful democracy would achieve a balance between the two. It would combine parliamentary (representative) democracy with participatory democracy. But no such balance is sought.
Representative democracy is a remarkably blunt instrument. Hundreds of issues are bundled together at every election, yet the vote tends to swing on just one or two of them. The government then presumes consent for its entire programme, and, if it commands a parliamentary majority, for anything else it wants to introduce in its term of office. We don’t accept presumed consent in sex. Why should we accept it in politics?
I’ve often been asked, when I complain about a government policy, “so why don’t you stand for election?”. This suggests that the only valid political role a citizen can play is to become a representative, meaning that only a tiny proportion of the population has a legitimate voice between elections. This is the shallowest and weakest of the possible conceptions of democracy.
I don’t want to abandon representative democracy. I want to see it balanced by popular sovereignty, especially the variety known as deliberative democracy. By contrast to the adversarial nature of representative democracy, in which politicians try to dominate and vanquish their opponents, deliberative democracy means drawing citizens together to solve problems. It means creating forums in which we listen respectfully to each other, seek to understand each other’s views, change our minds when necessary, and create the rich, informed democratic culture currently missing from national life.
Perhaps the best example is the participatory budgeting programme in the Brazilian city of Porto Alegre, particularly during its most effective phase, between 1989 and 2004. During these years, citizens were able to decide how the city’s entire investment budget should be spent. The process was designed by government and people working together, and was allowed to evolve as citizens suggested improvements. The budget discussions were open to everyone, and some 50,000 people a year participated.
Instead of being captured by corrupt politicians and local mafias, the people’s decisions ensured that the money went to where it was needed most, greatly improving sanitation, clean water, green space, health and education, transforming the lives of the poor. Porto Alegre became the Brazilian state capital with the highest ranking on the human development index. The more people engaged, the wider and deeper their political understanding became. Short-termism was replaced by long-term thinking: essential if we are to confront environmental breakdown.
There are plenty of other ways in which deliberative democracy can change our lives. In Ireland, a citizens’ assembly on abortion law turned an angry debate into a considered one, tested competing claims and ideas, and led eventually to a referendum. The Better Reykjavík programme allows the citizens of Iceland’s capital to put forward ideas for the city’s improvement, that other people vote on. The fifteen most popular ideas every month are passed to the city council to consider. The programme has remodelled the city in fascinating ways.
Constitutional conventions can be used to draw up principles of government, on which the rest of the population can then vote. The best models are perhaps those developed by the Canadian provinces of British Columbia and Ontario. Members of the convention are drawn by lot, and informed by experts, field trips and submissions from other citizens. The UK seems to be in urgent need of one.","How might the lack of participatory budgeting mechanisms in the UK's current electoral system contribute to the perpetuation of systemic inequalities, and what potential benefits could be gained by incorporating such mechanisms to promote more inclusive decision-making processes?",The lack of participatory budgeting mechanisms in the UK's current electoral system can perpetuate systemic inequalities by limiting the involvement of marginalized communities in decision-making processes.,"['https://www.local.gov.uk/topics/devolution/devolution-online-hub/public-service-reform-tools/engaging-citizens-devolution-5', 'https://involve.org.uk/resource/participatory-budgeting', 'https://www.wcpp.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/PPIW-report_participatory-budgeting-evidence-review_-July-2017-FINAL.pdf', 'https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5a74e08040f0b65c0e845331/19932231.pdf', 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23812346.2022.2035487', 'https://www.files.ethz.ch/isn/191229/WP168.pdf', 'https://www.iied.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/migrate/G02860.pdf', 'https://www.un.org/esa/desa/papers/2020/wp163_2020.pdf', 'https://www.pure.ed.ac.uk/ws/files/26488548/democracy_paper_lapsley.pdf', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3340230', 'https://www.local.gov.uk/topics/devolution/devolution-online-hub/public-service-reform-tools/engaging-citizens-devolution-5', 'https://involve.org.uk/resource/participatory-budgeting', 'https://www.wcpp.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/PPIW-report_participatory-budgeting-evidence-review_-July-2017-FINAL.pdf', 'https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5a74e08040f0b65c0e845331/19932231.pdf', 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23812346.2022.2035487', 'https://www.files.ethz.ch/isn/191229/WP168.pdf', 'https://www.iied.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/migrate/G02860.pdf', 'https://www.un.org/esa/desa/papers/2020/wp163_2020.pdf', 'https://www.pure.ed.ac.uk/ws/files/26488548/democracy_paper_lapsley.pdf', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3340230', 'https://www.local.gov.uk/topics/devolution/devolution-online-hub/public-service-reform-tools/engaging-citizens-devolution-5', 'https://involve.org.uk/resource/participatory-budgeting', 'https://www.wcpp.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/PPIW-report_participatory-budgeting-evidence-review_-July-2017-FINAL.pdf', 'https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5a74e08040f0b65c0e845331/19932231.pdf', 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23812346.2022.2035487', 'https://www.files.ethz.ch/isn/191229/WP168.pdf', 'https://www.iied.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/migrate/G02860.pdf', 'https://www.un.org/esa/desa/papers/2020/wp163_2020.pdf', 'https://www.pure.ed.ac.uk/ws/files/26488548/democracy_paper_lapsley.pdf', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3340230', 'https://www.local.gov.uk/topics/devolution/devolution-online-hub/public-service-reform-tools/engaging-citizens-devolution-5', 'https://involve.org.uk/resource/participatory-budgeting', 'https://www.wcpp.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/PPIW-report_participatory-budgeting-evidence-review_-July-2017-FINAL.pdf', 'https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5a74e08040f0b65c0e845331/19932231.pdf', 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23812346.2022.2035487', 'https://www.files.ethz.ch/isn/191229/WP168.pdf', 'https://www.iied.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/migrate/G02860.pdf', 'https://www.un.org/esa/desa/papers/2020/wp163_2020.pdf', 'https://www.pure.ed.ac.uk/ws/files/26488548/democracy_paper_lapsley.pdf', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3340230']",politics

1. Create an inclusive and respectful environment: This can be achieved by fostering a culture of openness, respect, and empathy, where all stakeholders feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions.

2. Empower minority voices: This can be done by providing opportunities for minority stakeholders to participate in the decision-making process, and by actively seeking out and amplifying their voices.

3. Use inclusive decision-making processes: This can be achieved by using processes that value diversity and promote inclusivity, such as consensus-based decision-making or collaborative problem-solving.

4. Consider the potential consequences of decisions: This can be done by conducting thorough impact assessments and considering the potential effects of decisions on vulnerable populations.

5. Foster dialogue and communication: This can be achieved by encouraging open and respectful communication among stakeholders, and by providing opportunities for dialogue and negotiation.

6. Build diverse teams: This can be done by building teams that reflect the diversity of the community, and by providing training and resources to support inclusive decision-making.

7. Provide education and training: This can be done by providing education and training on inclusive decision-making, and by promoting a culture of inclusivity and respect.

8. Engage marginalized communities: This can be done by engaging marginalized communities in the decision-making process, and by actively seeking out and amplifying their voices.

9. Use technology to facilitate inclusivity: This can be done by using technology to facilitate communication and participation among stakeholders, and by providing access to information and resources.

10. Monitor and evaluate: This can be done by monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of inclusive decision-making processes, and by making adjustments as needed.

By employing these strategies, governments can successfully integrate diverse stakeholders and perspectives in a deliberative democracy process, ensuring that minority voices are heard and valued in the decision-making process, without compromising the overall goal of achieving a collective decision, while also considering the potential consequences of such decisions on the most vulnerable populations.","['https://strategichrinc.com/inclusive-decision-making/', 'https://www.linkedin.com/advice/3/whats-your-strategy-inclusive-decision-making', 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30747556/', 'https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/3-ways-promote-inclusive-decision-making-elizabeth-m-adams-', 'https://www.innovativehumancapital.com/article/embracing-diversity-navigating-challenges-in-implementing-inclusive-decision-making-processes', 'https://www.conference-board.org/blog/corporate-citizenship/Inclusive-Decision-Making-Better-Results', 'https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/inclusive-policy-making_5k3tx6gb7s8p.pdf?itemId=%2Fcontent%2Fcomponent%2Fgov_glance-2013-51-en&mimeType=pdf', 'https://www.cloverpop.com/hubfs/Whitepapers/Cloverpop_Hacking_Diversity_Inclusive_Decision_Making_White_Paper.pdf', 'https://www.cogitatiopress.com/socialinclusion/article/view/6427', 'https://www.bridgespan.org/insights/nonprofit-organizational-effectiveness/5-ways-nonprofits-make-decision-making-inclusive', 'https://www.americanprogress.org/article/elevating-student-voice-education/', 'https://fastercapital.com/content/Minority-Shareholders--Empowering-Your-Voice-in-Closely-Held-Shares.html', 'https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jeroenkraaijenbrink_peoplemanagement-decisionmaking-organizationalmanagement-activity-7118249168988483584-RhrA', 'https://sustainability.yale.edu/blog/how-support-environmental-justice-everyday', 'https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2012/03/revenga.htm', 'https://www.socialpinpoint.com/10-tips-to-encourage-community-engagement-in-diverse-communities/', 'https://highways.dot.gov/safety/zero-deaths/engage-community-representatives', 'https://youth.gov/youth-topics/involving-youth-positive-youth-development', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6996004/', 'https://www.commonwealthfund.org/blog/2022/engaging-voice-support-racially-equitable-policymaking', 'https://strategichrinc.com/inclusive-decision-making/', 'https://www.linkedin.com/advice/3/whats-your-strategy-inclusive-decision-making', 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30747556/', 'https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/3-ways-promote-inclusive-decision-making-elizabeth-m-adams-', 'https://www.innovativehumancapital.com/article/embracing-diversity-navigating-challenges-in-implementing-inclusive-decision-making-processes', 'https://www.conference-board.org/blog/corporate-citizenship/Inclusive-Decision-Making-Better-Results', 'https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/inclusive-policy-making_5k3tx6gb7s8p.pdf?itemId=%2Fcontent%2Fcomponent%2Fgov_glance-2013-51-en&mimeType=pdf', 'https://www.cloverpop.com/hubfs/Whitepapers/Cloverpop_Hacking_Diversity_Inclusive_Decision_Making_White_Paper.pdf', 'https://www.cogitatiopress.com/socialinclusion/article/view/6427', 'https://www.bridgespan.org/insights/nonprofit-organizational-effectiveness/5-ways-nonprofits-make-decision-making-inclusive']",politics
"If politicians genuinely respected “the people’s will”, they would let us express it between elections.
By George Monbiot, published in the Guardian 24th October 2019
They promised sovereignty, but at first it was unclear which variety of sovereignty they meant. Were the politicians who swore we would regain it when we left the European Union referring to parliamentary sovereignty or popular sovereignty? Now we know they didn’t mean parliamentary sovereignty. Boris Johnson’s government has sought to trick, rush, ignore and prorogue Parliament at every turn.
“People v Parliament” is his pitch to the nation. So where do the people come in? If Johnson is a champion of popular sovereignty, why does he propose no improvements to a 19th Century model of democracy, that permits no popular engagement other than an election every few years, and a referendum every few decades?
There is a tension between parliamentary and popular sovereignty. A lively, meaningful democracy would achieve a balance between the two. It would combine parliamentary (representative) democracy with participatory democracy. But no such balance is sought.
Representative democracy is a remarkably blunt instrument. Hundreds of issues are bundled together at every election, yet the vote tends to swing on just one or two of them. The government then presumes consent for its entire programme, and, if it commands a parliamentary majority, for anything else it wants to introduce in its term of office. We don’t accept presumed consent in sex. Why should we accept it in politics?
I’ve often been asked, when I complain about a government policy, “so why don’t you stand for election?”. This suggests that the only valid political role a citizen can play is to become a representative, meaning that only a tiny proportion of the population has a legitimate voice between elections. This is the shallowest and weakest of the possible conceptions of democracy.
I don’t want to abandon representative democracy. I want to see it balanced by popular sovereignty, especially the variety known as deliberative democracy. By contrast to the adversarial nature of representative democracy, in which politicians try to dominate and vanquish their opponents, deliberative democracy means drawing citizens together to solve problems. It means creating forums in which we listen respectfully to each other, seek to understand each other’s views, change our minds when necessary, and create the rich, informed democratic culture currently missing from national life.
Perhaps the best example is the participatory budgeting programme in the Brazilian city of Porto Alegre, particularly during its most effective phase, between 1989 and 2004. During these years, citizens were able to decide how the city’s entire investment budget should be spent. The process was designed by government and people working together, and was allowed to evolve as citizens suggested improvements. The budget discussions were open to everyone, and some 50,000 people a year participated.
Instead of being captured by corrupt politicians and local mafias, the people’s decisions ensured that the money went to where it was needed most, greatly improving sanitation, clean water, green space, health and education, transforming the lives of the poor. Porto Alegre became the Brazilian state capital with the highest ranking on the human development index. The more people engaged, the wider and deeper their political understanding became. Short-termism was replaced by long-term thinking: essential if we are to confront environmental breakdown.
There are plenty of other ways in which deliberative democracy can change our lives. In Ireland, a citizens’ assembly on abortion law turned an angry debate into a considered one, tested competing claims and ideas, and led eventually to a referendum. The Better Reykjavík programme allows the citizens of Iceland’s capital to put forward ideas for the city’s improvement, that other people vote on. The fifteen most popular ideas every month are passed to the city council to consider. The programme has remodelled the city in fascinating ways.
Constitutional conventions can be used to draw up principles of government, on which the rest of the population can then vote. The best models are perhaps those developed by the Canadian provinces of British Columbia and Ontario. Members of the convention are drawn by lot, and informed by experts, field trips and submissions from other citizens. The UK seems to be in urgent need of one.","In a scenario where a city is facing a severe drought, how can the government balance the interests of farmers who rely on irrigation with those of environmental groups advocating for water conservation, while also ensuring that the decision-making process is transparent, inclusive, and effective in addressing the crisis?","To balance the interests of farmers who rely on irrigation with those of environmental groups advocating for water conservation during a severe drought, the government can consider the following strategies:

1. Implement water-saving technologies and practices: This can include the use of drip irrigation, precision agriculture, and water-efficient crops.
2. Develop water conservation plans: These plans can include measures such as water rationing, water recycling, and water harvesting.
3. Promote water-saving behaviors: This can include public education campaigns, water-saving incentives, and water-saving technologies.
4. Encourage water conservation in agriculture: This can include the use of drought-resistant crops, conservation tillage, and cover crops.
5. Implement water pricing policies: This can include tiered water pricing, water taxes, and water subsidies.
6. Develop water storage infrastructure: This can include the construction of new reservoirs, dams, and water storage facilities.
7. Implement water conservation in urban areas: This can include water-saving technologies, water-efficient appliances, and water-saving behaviors.
8. Promote water conservation in industry: This can include water-saving technologies, water-efficient processes, and water-saving behaviors.
9. Implement water conservation in agriculture: This can include water-saving technologies, water-efficient irrigation systems, and water-saving behaviors.
10. Develop water conservation policies: This can include water conservation regulations, water conservation incentives, and water conservation education programs.

These strategies can help balance the interests of farmers who rely on irrigation with those of environmental groups advocating for water conservation during a severe drought.","['https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2022/03/23/blog032322-poor-and-vulnerable-countris-need-support-to-adapt-to-climate-change', 'https://www.ppic.org/publication/managing-water-and-farmland-transitions-in-the-san-joaquin-valley/', 'https://www.twdb.texas.gov/publications/State_Water_Plan/2002/TOC_Ch1.doc', 'https://www.ppic.org/publication/priorities-for-californias-water/', 'https://calmatters.org/environment/2019/05/future-of-california-water-supply/', 'https://digitalcommons.ursinus.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1013&context=environment_hon', 'https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/GlobalTrends_2040.pdf', 'https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/5987our-common-future.pdf', 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/rvr2.60', 'https://www.usda.gov/ccc', 'https://www.ppic.org/blog/a-balancing-act-for-the-colorado-river/', 'https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2022/03/23/blog032322-poor-and-vulnerable-countris-need-support-to-adapt-to-climate-change', 'https://www.doi.gov/priorities/addressing-the-drought-crisis', 'https://environment.ec.europa.eu/topics/water/water-scarcity-and-droughts_en', 'https://cwc.ca.gov/-/media/CWC-Website/Files/Documents/2024/01_January/Drought-Strategies-White-Paper_Final.pdf', 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/rvr2.60', 'https://www.nature.org/content/dam/tnc/nature/en/documents/WaterShareReport.pdf', 'https://www.blm.gov/press-release/biden-harris-administration-finalizes-strategy-guide-balanced-management-conservation', 'https://www.texastribune.org/2022/09/26/water-trades-texas-climate-change-drought/', 'https://drought.unl.edu/dustbowl/', 'https://www.ppic.org/blog/a-balancing-act-for-the-colorado-river/', 'https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2022/03/23/blog032322-poor-and-vulnerable-countris-need-support-to-adapt-to-climate-change', 'https://www.doi.gov/priorities/addressing-the-drought-crisis', 'https://environment.ec.europa.eu/topics/water/water-scarcity-and-droughts_en', 'https://cwc.ca.gov/-/media/CWC-Website/Files/Documents/2024/01_January/Drought-Strategies-White-Paper_Final.pdf', 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/rvr2.60', 'https://www.nature.org/content/dam/tnc/nature/en/documents/WaterShareReport.pdf', 'https://www.blm.gov/press-release/biden-harris-administration-finalizes-strategy-guide-balanced-management-conservation', 'https://www.texastribune.org/2022/09/26/water-trades-texas-climate-change-drought/', 'https://drought.unl.edu/dustbowl/']",politics

Brief History of Multilateralism
- Concert of Europe: The end of the Napoleonic wars in Europe saw the establishment of the Concert of Europe, with the great powers redrawing European borders peacefully at the Congress of Vienna.
- League of Nations: The First World War destroyed the European Concert and replaced it with League of Nations.
- UN, IMF & IB: The post-World War II world saw the creation of a new world order sustained by multilateral and supranational institutions such as the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
Feel free to add more points in comments.","Can the increasing trend of countries hosting international conferences to address pressing global issues (e.g., climate change, pandemics) be seen as a resurgence of the multilateralism that characterized the post-World War II era, or is this merely a tactical response to global challenges?","The increasing trend of countries hosting international conferences to address pressing global issues can be seen as both a resurgence of multilateralism and a tactical response to global challenges. On one hand, the rise of multilateralism is a response to the growing complexity and interconnectedness of global issues, such as climate change, pandemics, and economic inequality. The increasing recognition of the need for collective action and cooperation to address these challenges has led to a resurgence of multilateralism, as seen in the growing number of international conferences and agreements.

On the other hand, the trend of countries hosting international conferences can also be seen as a tactical response to global challenges. In a rapidly changing and increasingly complex world, countries may be seeking to demonstrate their commitment to multilateralism and cooperation while also advancing their own national interests. This could involve using international conferences as a platform to promote their own agendas, build alliances, and shape the global agenda.

In conclusion, the increasing trend of countries hosting international conferences to address pressing global issues is a complex phenomenon that requires a nuanced analysis. While it can be seen as a resurgence of multilateralism, it is also likely a tactical response to global challenges.","['https://www.usip.org/publications/2023/09/amid-alarming-rise-conflict-multilateralism-only-answer', 'https://carnegieendowment.org/2023/01/23/four-contending-u.s.-approaches-to-multilateralism-pub-88852', 'https://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/the-rise-and-fall-of-multilateralism/', 'https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fandd/issues/2023/06/the-rise-of-discriminatory-regionalism-michele-ruta', 'https://theelders.org/news/elders-urge-revival-multilateralism-un-s-anniversary-reshape-world-after-covid-19', 'https://press.un.org/en/2018/sc13570.doc.htm', 'https://twitter.com/sidchat1/status/1813173381434646782', 'https://www.un.org/development/desa/dpad/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/publication/SDO_BP_Swain.pdf', 'https://www.eeas.europa.eu/eeas/how-revive-multilateralism-multipolar-world_en', 'https://www.cer.eu/sites/default/files/publications/attachments/pdf/2011/penttila_essay_july09-1334.pdf', 'https://www.usip.org/publications/2023/09/amid-alarming-rise-conflict-multilateralism-only-answer', 'https://carnegieendowment.org/2023/01/23/four-contending-u.s.-approaches-to-multilateralism-pub-88852', 'https://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/the-rise-and-fall-of-multilateralism/', 'https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fandd/issues/2023/06/the-rise-of-discriminatory-regionalism-michele-ruta', 'https://theelders.org/news/elders-urge-revival-multilateralism-un-s-anniversary-reshape-world-after-covid-19', 'https://press.un.org/en/2018/sc13570.doc.htm', 'https://twitter.com/sidchat1/status/1813173381434646782', 'https://www.un.org/development/desa/dpad/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/publication/SDO_BP_Swain.pdf', 'https://www.eeas.europa.eu/eeas/how-revive-multilateralism-multipolar-world_en', 'https://www.cer.eu/sites/default/files/publications/attachments/pdf/2011/penttila_essay_july09-1334.pdf', 'https://www.usip.org/publications/2023/09/amid-alarming-rise-conflict-multilateralism-only-answer', 'https://carnegieendowment.org/2023/01/23/four-contending-u.s.-approaches-to-multilateralism-pub-88852', 'https://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/the-rise-and-fall-of-multilateralism/', 'https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fandd/issues/2023/06/the-rise-of-discriminatory-regionalism-michele-ruta', 'https://theelders.org/news/elders-urge-revival-multilateralism-un-s-anniversary-reshape-world-after-covid-19', 'https://press.un.org/en/2018/sc13570.doc.htm', 'https://twitter.com/sidchat1/status/1813173381434646782', 'https://www.un.org/development/desa/dpad/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/publication/SDO_BP_Swain.pdf', 'https://www.eeas.europa.eu/eeas/how-revive-multilateralism-multipolar-world_en', 'https://www.cer.eu/sites/default/files/publications/attachments/pdf/2011/penttila_essay_july09-1334.pdf', 'https://www.usip.org/publications/2023/09/amid-alarming-rise-conflict-multilateralism-only-answer', 'https://carnegieendowment.org/2023/01/23/four-contending-u.s.-approaches-to-multilateralism-pub-88852', 'https://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/the-rise-and-fall-of-multilateralism/', 'https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fandd/issues/2023/06/the-rise-of-discriminatory-regionalism-michele-ruta', 'https://theelders.org/news/elders-urge-revival-multilateralism-un-s-anniversary-reshape-world-after-covid-19', 'https://press.un.org/en/2018/sc13570.doc.htm', 'https://twitter.com/sidchat1/status/1813173381434646782', 'https://www.un.org/development/desa/dpad/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/publication/SDO_BP_Swain.pdf', 'https://www.eeas.europa.eu/eeas/how-revive-multilateralism-multipolar-world_en', 'https://www.cer.eu/sites/default/files/publications/attachments/pdf/2011/penttila_essay_july09-1334.pdf']",politics

Feel free to add more points in comments.","How has the rise of social media platforms and their increasing influence on global public opinion contributed to the erosion of trust in international institutions, ultimately weakening the global multilateral system?","The erosion of trust in international institutions is a complex issue with multiple perspectives. The rise of social media has significantly impacted global public opinion, and its influence on international institutions is a topic of great concern. The erosion of trust in international institutions is a complex issue with multiple perspectives.

The erosion of trust in international institutions is a multifaceted phenomenon that can be attributed to various factors, including the rise of social media, declining trust in institutions, scorn for facts, legislative dysfunction, and the emergence of social media. The increasing influence of social media on global public opinion has led to a decline in trust in institutions, as people are more likely to believe information that confirms their existing beliefs and biases.

The erosion of trust in international institutions can have severe consequences, including the destabilization of the public's trust in election processes and results, the decline of democracy, and the erosion of the global multilateral system. The rise of social media has also led to the spread of misinformation, which can further erode trust in institutions.

To address the erosion of trust in international institutions, it is essential to promote media literacy, increase transparency and accountability, and foster a culture of trust and cooperation. International institutions must also adapt to the changing global landscape and find ways to engage with citizens and stakeholders in a more effective and transparent manner.

In conclusion, the erosion of trust in international institutions is a complex issue that requires a multifaceted approach. The rise of social media has significantly impacted global public opinion, and its influence on international institutions is a topic of great concern. To address this issue, it is essential to promote media literacy, increase transparency and accountability, and foster a culture of trust and cooperation.","['https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2021/653635/EXPO_STU(2021)653635_EN.pdf', 'https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-tech-platforms-fuel-u-s-political-polarization-and-what-government-can-do-about-it/', 'https://misinforeview.hks.harvard.edu/article/misinformation-in-action-fake-news-exposure-is-linked-to-lower-trust-in-media-higher-trust-in-government-when-your-side-is-in-power/', 'https://www.brookings.edu/articles/misinformation-is-eroding-the-publics-confidence-in-democracy/', 'https://carnegieendowment.org/2023/09/05/polarization-democracy-and-political-violence-in-united-states-what-research-says-pub-90457', 'https://www.accc.gov.au/system/files/ACCC+commissioned+report+-+The+impact+of+digital+platforms+on+news+and+journalistic+content,+Centre+for+Media+Transition+(2).pdf', 'https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2019/07/22/trust-and-distrust-in-america/', 'https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2018/05/10/blog-trust-and-the-future-of-multilateralism', 'https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/GlobalTrends_2040.pdf', 'https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR2314.html', 'https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2018/05/10/blog-trust-and-the-future-of-multilateralism', 'https://www.cfr.org/project/global-erosion-trust-and-democracy-and-its-implications-health-and-societies', 'https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/erosion-of-trust-in-international-institutions-continues-by-ana-palacio-2021-11', 'https://news.gallup.com/poll/394283/confidence-institutions-down-average-new-low.aspx', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3220891/', 'https://desapublications.un.org/file/18027/download', 'https://www.brookings.edu/articles/misinformation-is-eroding-the-publics-confidence-in-democracy/', 'https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2021/653635/EXPO_STU(2021)653635_EN.pdf', 'https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/06/24/public-trust-in-government-1958-2024/', 'https://www.edelman.com/trust/trust-barometer']",politics

The shift in global power dynamics is characterized by the increasing economic clout of emerging powers, which is transforming the global order and challenging traditional notions of sovereignty. The concept of sovereignty is being redefined, with emerging economies seeking to assert their influence and shape global governance institutions to better reflect their interests.

The impact of emerging economies on global governance is multifaceted, with both positive and negative consequences. On the one hand, the rise of emerging economies has led to increased economic cooperation and integration, which has fostered global economic growth and development. On the other hand, the shift in global power dynamics has also led to increased competition and tensions, particularly in areas such as trade, security, and technology.

The re-evaluation of sovereignty is also driven by the changing nature of global governance, with emerging economies seeking to assert their influence and shape global governance institutions to better reflect their interests. This has led to a shift towards more inclusive and participatory forms of global governance, with emerging economies playing a more prominent role in shaping global policies and institutions.

In conclusion, the rise of emerging economies has significant implications for the balance of power and influence in international relations, leading to a re-evaluation of the concept of sovereignty and its implications for global governance. The shift in global power dynamics is characterized by increased economic cooperation and integration, as well as increased competition and tensions, and is driving a re-evaluation of sovereignty and global governance institutions.","['https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/GlobalTrends_2040.pdf', 'https://www.irena.org/News/pressreleases/2022/Jan/Hydrogen-Economy-Hints-at-New-Global-Power-Dynamics', 'https://www.nationalww2museum.org/war/articles/new-global-power-after-world-war-ii-1945', 'https://www.irena.org/-/media/files/irena/agency/publication/2019/jan/global_commission_geopolitics_new_world_2019.pdf', 'https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2019/05/23/blog-the-impact-of-us-china-trade-tensions', 'https://www.international.gc.ca/transparency-transparence/indo-pacific-indo-pacifique/index.aspx?lang=eng', 'https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2015/sdn1513.pdf', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Biden-Harris-Administrations-National-Security-Strategy-10.2022.pdf', 'https://www.chathamhouse.org/2023/02/seven-ways-russias-war-ukraine-has-changed-world', 'https://academic.oup.com/jogss/article/6/4/ogab011/6217437', 'https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/GFSR/2022/April/English/ch2.ashx', 'https://www.nbr.org/publication/chinas-vision-for-cyber-sovereignty-and-the-global-governance-of-cyberspace/', 'https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2024/03/28/the-fiscal-and-financial-risks-of-a-high-debt-slow-growth-world', 'https://carnegieendowment.org/2023/09/12/rules-of-order-assessing-state-of-global-governance-pub-90517', 'https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/Global%20Trends_2025%20Global%20Governance.pdf', 'https://www.jstor.org/stable/44861138', 'https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/GlobalTrends_2040.pdf', 'https://academic.oup.com/ia/article/99/4/1755/7167127', 'https://www.cfr.org/china-global-governance/', 'https://www.nature.com/articles/palcomms201545', 'https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/GlobalTrends_2040.pdf', 'https://carnegieendowment.org/2023/09/12/rules-of-order-assessing-state-of-global-governance-pub-90517', 'https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/Global%20Trends_2025%20Global%20Governance.pdf', 'https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2024/03/28/the-fiscal-and-financial-risks-of-a-high-debt-slow-growth-world', 'https://usali.org/usali-perspectives-blog/understanding-chinas-growing-influence-in-global-data-governance', 'https://www.nature.com/articles/palcomms201545', 'https://www.cfr.org/china-global-governance/', 'https://policyreview.info/concepts/digital-sovereignty', 'https://www.nbr.org/publication/chinas-vision-for-cyber-sovereignty-and-the-global-governance-of-cyberspace/', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Biden-Harris-Administrations-National-Security-Strategy-10.2022.pdf']",politics

1. Increased human trafficking and smuggling: Without the treaty, countries may be less likely to cooperate in combating human trafficking and smuggling, leading to an increase in these illegal activities.
2. Protection of human rights: The treaty provides a framework for protecting the rights of migrants, including the right to life, liberty, and security of person. Without the treaty, these rights may be at risk.
3. Increased migration to other countries: If a country withdraws from the treaty, it may become less attractive to migrants, leading to an increase in migration to other countries that are still party to the treaty.
4. Negative impact on the global economy: The treaty provides a framework for managing migration and addressing its economic impacts. Without the treaty, the global economy may be negatively impacted.
5. Increased tensions between countries: The withdrawal of a country from the treaty may lead to increased tensions between countries, particularly if other countries are still party to the treaty.
6. Negative impact on the environment: The treaty provides a framework for addressing the environmental impacts of migration. Without the treaty, the environment may be negatively impacted.
7. Increased risk of conflict: The withdrawal of a country from the treaty may lead to increased tensions and conflict, particularly if other countries are still party to the treaty.
8. Negative impact on the global community: The treaty provides a framework for addressing the global impacts of migration. Without the treaty, the global community may be negatively impacted.

It is important to note that these are just a few potential unintended consequences of a country's decision to withdraw from a global treaty aimed at addressing the root causes of migration. The actual consequences may be different and may depend on a variety of factors, including the specific circumstances of the country and the global context.","['https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-journal-of-international-law/article/unintended-consequences-of-expanding-migrant-rights-protections/3F2C1AFDBFF42E08DD6F226DF55FDE6E', 'https://www.unodc.org/documents/human-trafficking/Migrant-Smuggling/Smuggling_of_Migrants_A_Global_Review.pdf', 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23340460.2020.1871301', 'https://www.unodc.org/documents/wdr/WDR_2009/WDR2009_Confronting_unintended_consequences.pdf', 'https://www.dni.gov/index.php/gt2040-home/gt2040-deeper-looks/future-of-water', 'https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/migration/generalassembly/docs/globalcompact/A_RES_71_1.pdf', 'https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/reorienting-perceptions-climate-change-migration-displacement', 'https://press.un.org/en/2023/sc15318.doc.htm', 'https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2016/sdn1606.pdf', 'https://www.fdic.gov/resources/regulations/federal-register-publications/2023/2023-regulatory-capital-rule-large-banking-organizations-3064-af29-c-306.pdf', 'https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-journal-of-international-law/article/unintended-consequences-of-expanding-migrant-rights-protections/3F2C1AFDBFF42E08DD6F226DF55FDE6E', 'https://www.unodc.org/documents/human-trafficking/Migrant-Smuggling/Smuggling_of_Migrants_A_Global_Review.pdf', 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23340460.2020.1871301', 'https://www.unodc.org/documents/wdr/WDR_2009/WDR2009_Confronting_unintended_consequences.pdf', 'https://www.dni.gov/index.php/gt2040-home/gt2040-deeper-looks/future-of-water', 'https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/migration/generalassembly/docs/globalcompact/A_RES_71_1.pdf', 'https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/reorienting-perceptions-climate-change-migration-displacement', 'https://press.un.org/en/2023/sc15318.doc.htm', 'https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2016/sdn1606.pdf', 'https://www.fdic.gov/resources/regulations/federal-register-publications/2023/2023-regulatory-capital-rule-large-banking-organizations-3064-af29-c-306.pdf', 'https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-journal-of-international-law/article/unintended-consequences-of-expanding-migrant-rights-protections/3F2C1AFDBFF42E08DD6F226DF55FDE6E', 'https://www.unodc.org/documents/human-trafficking/Migrant-Smuggling/Smuggling_of_Migrants_A_Global_Review.pdf', 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23340460.2020.1871301', 'https://www.unodc.org/documents/wdr/WDR_2009/WDR2009_Confronting_unintended_consequences.pdf', 'https://www.dni.gov/index.php/gt2040-home/gt2040-deeper-looks/future-of-water', 'https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/migration/generalassembly/docs/globalcompact/A_RES_71_1.pdf', 'https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/reorienting-perceptions-climate-change-migration-displacement', 'https://press.un.org/en/2023/sc15318.doc.htm', 'https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2016/sdn1606.pdf', 'https://www.fdic.gov/resources/regulations/federal-register-publications/2023/2023-regulatory-capital-rule-large-banking-organizations-3064-af29-c-306.pdf', 'https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-journal-of-international-law/article/unintended-consequences-of-expanding-migrant-rights-protections/3F2C1AFDBFF42E08DD6F226DF55FDE6E', 'https://www.unodc.org/documents/human-trafficking/Migrant-Smuggling/Smuggling_of_Migrants_A_Global_Review.pdf', 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23340460.2020.1871301', 'https://www.unodc.org/documents/wdr/WDR_2009/WDR2009_Confronting_unintended_consequences.pdf', 'https://www.dni.gov/index.php/gt2040-home/gt2040-deeper-looks/future-of-water', 'https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/migration/generalassembly/docs/globalcompact/A_RES_71_1.pdf', 'https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/reorienting-perceptions-climate-change-migration-displacement', 'https://press.un.org/en/2023/sc15318.doc.htm', 'https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2016/sdn1606.pdf', 'https://www.fdic.gov/resources/regulations/federal-register-publications/2023/2023-regulatory-capital-rule-large-banking-organizations-3064-af29-c-306.pdf']",politics
"- Many different factors can be influential on the choice of the people in free and fair elections which are the requirements of democracy. Economic, political, social, and other reasons determine people’s political choice and political power. However, how this people’s will can be reflected, how the votes will be counted, how it will be represented and how many seats it will correspond to are actually determined according to the election laws. Also, electoral laws, like all laws, are actually the product of the legislature’s political choice. Moreover, since the election laws have a special and direct effect and importance on the determination of the next election result and the next political power, they are the laws that it especially is wanted to shape by the current political power in order to ensure their continuity. However, like many other laws, it is important for legal security that they preserve certain basic principles, conform to the constitution of the country, and have little variability. Moreover, the frequent changes in election laws depending on the political power is a threat to democracy. In other words, stable electoral laws in accordance with the constitution and the requirements of democracy are the requirement of free and fair election and the legal and formal condition of the fair reflection of the will of the voters.
- Electoral laws are basically based on the political choice of the legislator over how to resolve the conflict of interest between the fair representation of the votes, and the creation of strong and thus stable governments. Italy also for the same purposes, from the beginning of the reform process until today, four law changes have been made under different names. These changes; Mattarellum made in 1993, Porcellum made in 2005, Italicum made in 2014, and Rosatellum made in 2017.
- During the process that started with the arrest of Mario Chiesa from the Italian Socialist Party (PSI) on February 17, 1992, on the grounds that he was bribed, a serious network of corruption emerged within the political parties. In the continuation of the process, the decrease in trust in political parties and the economic problems experienced by political parties led to the shrinkage of political parties and this situation caused the 1993 Election Reform (MATTARELLUM) to come into effect. The most important aspect of this change is that the proportional representation system, which has been applied since 1948, was terminated and the transition to the mixed system. Proportional representation electoral systems, on the other hand, are the common name of systems that require political parties to be represented in proportion to their votes. For this reason, it can be said that as a result of this election law, a majoritarian understanding has been adopted. This understanding resulted in the bipolar formation of political life and an increase in pre-election alliances.
- The 2005 election reform (PORCELLUM) is the Berlusconi government’s amendment to the electoral law for purely political motives. This change has many unusual and troublesome features. Firstly, the electoral law change was made just before the election. Secondly, the method of voting candidates for parties by lists has been adopted, but some electoral districts are still allowed to nominate individual candidates. One of the most interesting aspects of the change is that it allows a candidate to be included in the list of more than one constituency. For example, Berlusconi ran as the top of the list in all electoral districts. In addition, a premium system that can transform the simple majority into absolute majority has been adopted. In order to ensure stability in the administration, according to this regulation, the number of seats of the party or alliance that received the highest number of votes at the “national level” in the parliamentary elections is increased to 340. However, this regulation seriously harms the principle of fairness in representation. This situation was clearly observed especially in the 2013 elections. “According to the 2013 election results, each of the alliances (the left alliance led by the Democratic Party and the right alliance led by Forza Italy) and the Five Star Movement received over 25% of the vote. Even though it won the election by a very small margin, it also won the majority with the most votes. As a matter of fact, although the left alliance had 29% of the votes, it was entitled to the majority because it received the highest vote among those participating in the election. Thus, the representation rate in the Assembly of Deputies suddenly reached 54% due to the majority premium. ” (Altınsu & Arıkan)","Can you describe a scenario where a political party, seeking to maintain its power, manipulates the voting process to alter the outcome of an election, and how this might affect the representation of different groups in the legislature?","The manipulation of the voting process can have significant consequences on the representation of different groups in the legislature. It can lead to the suppression of certain groups' votes, such as racial and ethnic minorities, low-income communities, and marginalized populations. This can result in a lack of representation and a disproportionate impact on these groups' interests and needs.

For example, gerrymandering, a form of electoral manipulation, can lead to the creation of voting districts that are designed to favor one political party or group over another. This can result in the underrepresentation of certain groups and the overrepresentation of others. Additionally, the manipulation of voting processes can lead to the disenfranchisement of certain groups, such as those with disabilities or language barriers, who may face barriers in accessing the voting process.

Furthermore, the manipulation of voting processes can also lead to the erosion of trust in the electoral system, which can have long-term consequences for democracy. When voters feel that the system is rigged or that their votes are not being counted, they may become disillusioned with the political process and less likely to participate in future elections.

In conclusion, the manipulation of the voting process can have significant consequences on the representation of different groups in the legislature. It is essential to ensure that the voting process is fair, transparent, and accessible to all eligible voters in order to maintain the integrity of democracy.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud', 'https://www.aclu.org/news/civil-liberties/block-the-vote-voter-suppression-in-2020', 'https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/25120/chapter/7', 'https://campaignlegal.org/update/how-artificial-intelligence-influences-elections-and-what-we-can-do-about-it', 'https://www.cisa.gov/topics/election-security/rumor-vs-reality', 'https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/gerrymandering-explained', 'https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Report_Volume1.pdf', 'https://www.brookings.edu/articles/misinformation-is-eroding-the-publics-confidence-in-democracy/', 'https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/news/releases/op-ed-mail-ballots-threat-democracy', 'https://www.federaltimes.com/opinions/2024/06/11/how-to-combat-cyber-threats-and-secure-democracy-in-the-digital-age/', 'https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/gerrymandering-explained', 'https://www.aclu.org/news/civil-liberties/block-the-vote-voter-suppression-in-2020', 'https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2021/653635/EXPO_STU(2021)653635_EN.pdf', 'https://www.brookings.edu/articles/misinformation-is-eroding-the-publics-confidence-in-democracy/', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud', 'https://www.cisa.gov/topics/election-security/rumor-vs-reality', 'https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/25120/chapter/7', 'https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10602-022-09376-8', 'https://policyreview.info/articles/analysis/voter-preferences-voter-manipulation-voter-analytics-policy-options-less', 'https://www.jstor.org/stable/1914083']",politics

Moreover, the frequent changes in election laws depending on the political power is a threat to democracy. In other words, stable electoral laws in accordance with the constitution and the requirements of democracy are the requirement of free and fair election and the legal and formal condition of the fair reflection of the will of the voters.
- Electoral laws are basically based on the political choice of the legislator over how to resolve the conflict of interest between the fair representation of the votes, and the creation of strong and thus stable governments. Italy also for the same purposes, from the beginning of the reform process until today, four law changes have been made under different names. These changes; Mattarellum made in 1993, Porcellum made in 2005, Italicum made in 2014, and Rosatellum made in 2017.
- During the process that started with the arrest of Mario Chiesa from the Italian Socialist Party (PSI) on February 17, 1992, on the grounds that he was bribed, a serious network of corruption emerged within the political parties. In the continuation of the process, the decrease in trust in political parties and the economic problems experienced by political parties led to the shrinkage of political parties and this situation caused the 1993 Election Reform (MATTARELLUM) to come into effect. The most important aspect of this change is that the proportional representation system, which has been applied since 1948, was terminated and the transition to the mixed system. Proportional representation electoral systems, on the other hand, are the common name of systems that require political parties to be represented in proportion to their votes. For this reason, it can be said that as a result of this election law, a majoritarian understanding has been adopted. This understanding resulted in the bipolar formation of political life and an increase in pre-election alliances.
- The 2005 election reform (PORCELLUM) is the Berlusconi government’s amendment to the electoral law for purely political motives. This change has many unusual and troublesome features. Firstly, the electoral law change was made just before the election. Secondly, the method of voting candidates for parties by lists has been adopted, but some electoral districts are still allowed to nominate individual candidates. One of the most interesting aspects of the change is that it allows a candidate to be included in the list of more than one constituency. For example, Berlusconi ran as the top of the list in all electoral districts. In addition, a premium system that can transform the simple majority into absolute majority has been adopted. In order to ensure stability in the administration, according to this regulation, the number of seats of the party or alliance that received the highest number of votes at the “national level” in the parliamentary elections is increased to 340. However, this regulation seriously harms the principle of fairness in representation. This situation was clearly observed especially in the 2013 elections. “According to the 2013 election results, each of the alliances (the left alliance led by the Democratic Party and the right alliance led by Forza Italy) and the Five Star Movement received over 25% of the vote. Even though it won the election by a very small margin, it also won the majority with the most votes. As a matter of fact, although the left alliance had 29% of the votes, it was entitled to the majority because it received the highest vote among those participating in the election. Thus, the representation rate in the Assembly of Deputies suddenly reached 54% due to the majority premium. ” (Altınsu & Arıkan)","How might a shift in voter attitudes towards centrist politics in Italy impact the likelihood of coalitions forming after the next election, and what consequences might this have for the country's economic policy?","The final answer is:

A shift in voter attitudes towards centrist politics in Italy could significantly impact the likelihood of coalitions forming after the next election. Centrist parties have historically played a crucial role in Italian politics, often serving as a bridge between the left and right wings. If centrist voters increase their support for centrist parties, it could lead to a more fragmented political landscape, making it more challenging for coalitions to form.

A shift in voter attitudes towards centrist politics in Italy could have significant consequences for the country's economic policy. Centrist parties have historically been more likely to adopt moderate economic policies, such as fiscal responsibility and market-oriented reforms. If centrist voters increase their support for centrist parties, it could lead to a more stable and predictable economic policy environment.

This could lead to a more representative and accountable government, as voters would be able to choose representatives who better reflect their interests and values.

In a system of direct representation, voters would be able to choose individual candidates rather than parties, which could lead to a more diverse range of representatives. This could be particularly beneficial in countries where party lists often dominate the electoral process, and voters have limited options for choosing individual representatives.

However, it's also important to note that direct representation can also lead to a more fragmented and unstable government, as individual representatives may not have the same level of party discipline as representatives elected through party lists. This could lead to a more complex and challenging legislative process, as individual representatives may have different priorities and agendas.

Overall, the impact of direct representation on the representation rate in the Assembly of Deputies would depend on various factors, including the specific electoral system, the level of party discipline, and the degree of voter engagement and participation.","['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_representation', 'https://ine.mx/the-mexican-electoral-system/', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party-list_proportional_representation', 'https://www.nlrb.gov/guidance/key-reference-materials/national-labor-relations-act', 'https://www.acquisition.gov/far/part-52', 'https://www.bmi.bund.de/EN/topics/constitution/electoral-law/voting-system/voting-system-node.html', 'https://grants.nih.gov/grants/glossary.htm', 'https://fairvote.org/archives/proportional-representation-voting-systems/', 'https://benefits.va.gov/vso/', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261379421000500', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_representation', 'https://ine.mx/the-mexican-electoral-system/', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party-list_proportional_representation', 'https://www.nlrb.gov/guidance/key-reference-materials/national-labor-relations-act', 'https://www.acquisition.gov/far/part-52', 'https://www.bmi.bund.de/EN/topics/constitution/electoral-law/voting-system/voting-system-node.html', 'https://grants.nih.gov/grants/glossary.htm', 'https://fairvote.org/archives/proportional-representation-voting-systems/', 'https://benefits.va.gov/vso/', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261379421000500', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_representation', 'https://ine.mx/the-mexican-electoral-system/', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party-list_proportional_representation', 'https://www.nlrb.gov/guidance/key-reference-materials/national-labor-relations-act', 'https://www.acquisition.gov/far/part-52', 'https://www.bmi.bund.de/EN/topics/constitution/electoral-law/voting-system/voting-system-node.html', 'https://grants.nih.gov/grants/glossary.htm', 'https://fairvote.org/archives/proportional-representation-voting-systems/', 'https://benefits.va.gov/vso/', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261379421000500', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_representation', 'https://ine.mx/the-mexican-electoral-system/', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party-list_proportional_representation', 'https://www.nlrb.gov/guidance/key-reference-materials/national-labor-relations-act', 'https://www.acquisition.gov/far/part-52', 'https://www.bmi.bund.de/EN/topics/constitution/electoral-law/voting-system/voting-system-node.html', 'https://grants.nih.gov/grants/glossary.htm', 'https://fairvote.org/archives/proportional-representation-voting-systems/', 'https://benefits.va.gov/vso/', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261379421000500']",politics
"Rigid Constitution: The separation of powers created by the Constitution, as well as the Constitution's supremacy, can only be preserved if the system of modification is rigid. As a result, the Constitution is inflexible to the point that those parts dealing with the federal structure (i.e., Center–state relations and judicial organization) can only be modified by a joint decision of the Central and state governments. Such regulations necessitate a special majority in Parliament as well as the consent of half of the state legislatures in order to be amended.
Independent Judiciary: The Constitution established an independent judiciary led by the Supreme Court for two purposes: one, to safeguard the supremacy of the Constitution through the exercise of judicial review; and two, to settle disputes between the Centre and the states or between the states. To make the judiciary independent of the government, the Constitution includes provisions such as tenure security for judges, defined service conditions, and so on.
Bicameralism: The Constitution establishes a bicameral legislature with an Upper House (Rajya Sabha) and a Lower House (Lok Sabha). The Rajya Sabha represents the states of the Indian Federation, whereas the Lok Sabha represents the entire population of India. The Rajya Sabha (despite being a weaker chamber) is responsible for maintaining federal equilibrium by safeguarding state interests against undue interference from the Centre.
Fact to Remember
There is one more important feature of Federalism besides the above written points and that is called ""Dual Citizenship"". It means that both the Union and the State have their different citizenship and the best example of this is the United States of America. But in the case of India, federalism is a little bit different. A kind of quasi federalism is found here. Dual Citizenship is not part of Indian Federalism.
Thus, in this article we have covered detailed information about federalism. The term ""federalism"" is said to have come from the Latin word ""foedus,"" which means ""covenant, contract, or treaty."" Federalism is a principle that describes a government structure in which authority is divided between the national and state governments. It is a two-machine system that governs a country. The central government and numerous state authorities have different levels of power.","What are the potential consequences of a situation where a state government passes a law that conflicts with the national interest, and the Supreme Court is called upon to invalidate it, but the state government refuses to comply with the court's decision?","The potential consequences of a situation where a state government passes a law that conflicts with the national interest, and the Supreme Court is called upon to invalidate it, but the state government refuses to comply with the court's decision, are far-reaching and complex.

The Supreme Court's decision would likely be based on the Constitution's Supremacy Clause, which establishes the federal government's authority over state governments. If the state government refuses to comply with the court's decision, it could lead to a constitutional crisis, as the federal government would be unable to enforce its laws and regulations.

Some potential consequences of this scenario include:

1. Gridlock and stalemate: The conflict between the state government and the federal government could lead to a stalemate, with neither side willing to compromise. This could result in a lack of effective governance and a failure to address important national issues.
2. Erosion of federal authority: If the state government is able to defy the Supreme Court's decision, it could undermine the federal government's authority and create a precedent for other states to follow. This could lead to a breakdown in the system of federalism and a loss of national unity.
3. Increased tensions and conflict: The conflict between the state government and the federal government could lead to increased tensions and conflict, potentially even violence. This could be particularly problematic if the issue at hand is a sensitive or controversial one, such as immigration or healthcare.
4. Economic consequences: The conflict could also have significant economic consequences, as businesses and investors may be hesitant to operate in a state that is in conflict with the federal government. This could lead to a decline in economic activity and a loss of jobs and revenue.
5. International implications: The conflict could also have international implications, as other countries may view the situation as a sign of instability and weakness in the United States. This could lead to a decline in the country's global influence and reputation.

In conclusion, the potential consequences of a situation where a state government passes a law that conflicts with the national interest, and the Supreme Court is called upon to invalidate it, but the state government refuses to comply with the court's decision, are far-reaching and complex. It is essential that the federal government and the state government work together to find a solution that respects the Constitution and the rule of law.","['https://www.state.gov/united-states-strategy-to-prevent-conflict-and-promote-stability/', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Biden-Harris-Administrations-National-Security-Strategy-10.2022.pdf', 'https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/ATA-2023-Unclassified-Report.pdf', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/National-Cybersecurity-Strategy-2023.pdf', 'https://www.nps.gov/locations/alaska/upload/anilca-electronic-version.pdf', 'https://www.congress.gov/bill/96th-congress/house-bill/39', 'https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ofccp/national-interest-exemption', 'https://www.acquisition.gov/far/part-3', 'https://www.councilofnonprofits.org/running-nonprofit/governance-leadership/conflicts-interest', 'https://www.energy.gov/gdo/national-interest-electric-transmission-corridor-designation-process', 'https://www.state.gov/united-states-strategy-to-prevent-conflict-and-promote-stability/', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Biden-Harris-Administrations-National-Security-Strategy-10.2022.pdf', 'https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/ATA-2023-Unclassified-Report.pdf', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/National-Cybersecurity-Strategy-2023.pdf', 'https://www.nps.gov/locations/alaska/upload/anilca-electronic-version.pdf', 'https://www.congress.gov/bill/96th-congress/house-bill/39', 'https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ofccp/national-interest-exemption', 'https://www.acquisition.gov/far/part-3', 'https://www.councilofnonprofits.org/running-nonprofit/governance-leadership/conflicts-interest', 'https://www.energy.gov/gdo/national-interest-electric-transmission-corridor-designation-process', 'https://www.state.gov/united-states-strategy-to-prevent-conflict-and-promote-stability/', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Biden-Harris-Administrations-National-Security-Strategy-10.2022.pdf', 'https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/ATA-2023-Unclassified-Report.pdf', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/National-Cybersecurity-Strategy-2023.pdf', 'https://www.nps.gov/locations/alaska/upload/anilca-electronic-version.pdf', 'https://www.congress.gov/bill/96th-congress/house-bill/39', 'https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ofccp/national-interest-exemption', 'https://www.acquisition.gov/far/part-3', 'https://www.councilofnonprofits.org/running-nonprofit/governance-leadership/conflicts-interest', 'https://www.energy.gov/gdo/national-interest-electric-transmission-corridor-designation-process']",politics

10. Area Competence / Expertise
In today’s age, the significance of knowledge in every aspect of jobs is less important than it was. In creative firms or high-tech industries, the team members might possess more relevant knowledge and expertise than the leaders. Still, leaders must develop expertise in particular situations, industries, or organizations where they are in leadership roles.
How to develop Area Competencies?
Development is a lifelong process, similar to all the other competencies. You need to study the organization and also study the competitors of the organization. Effective leaders gain competence and expertise and attempt to gain as much knowledge as possible regarding their organization, product, and team members.
Apart from the above-mentioned competencies, leaders should also possess the competencies of agility, speed, passion, and focus to succeed. Such skills, however, cannot be taught. If an organization requires and supports these leadership competencies as a basis of its success, they must be instilled through an embedded system of leadership development. The success of such a program is dependent on five crucial factors, which include the –
- Support provided by the Executive Leadership
- Challenging work assignments
- The right people
- The supportive environment of work
- Instead of a course for skills, there should be a Leadership Development System.","What would you suggest as a key performance indicator to measure the effectiveness of a leader in preventing and resolving conflicts in the workplace, and how would you incorporate this indicator into the overall evaluation of their leadership performance?","The final answer is:

To measure the effectiveness of a leader in preventing and resolving conflicts in the workplace, I would suggest a key performance indicator (KPI) that assesses their ability to foster a positive and productive work environment. This KPI could be a combination of the following metrics:

1. Employee Satisfaction and Engagement Surveys: This metric measures the level of satisfaction and engagement among employees, which can indicate the effectiveness of conflict resolution initiatives.
2. Turnover Rate: A low turnover rate indicates that employees are satisfied with their work environment and are less likely to leave the organization due to conflicts.
3. Client Satisfaction Rate: This metric measures the level of satisfaction clients have with the conflict management services provided by the organization.
4. Average Time Taken to Resolve Conflicts: This metric measures the efficiency of the conflict resolution process and can indicate the effectiveness of the leader's conflict resolution strategies.
5. Number of Successful Conflict Resolutions: This metric measures the number of conflicts that are successfully resolved, which can indicate the effectiveness of the leader's conflict resolution strategies.
6. Employee Retention Rate: A high employee retention rate indicates that employees are satisfied with their work environment and are less likely to leave the organization due to conflicts.
7. Workplace Happiness: This metric measures the overall happiness and well-being of employees, which can indicate the effectiveness of the leader's conflict resolution initiatives.

To incorporate this KPI into the overall evaluation of the leader's performance, I would suggest the following:

1. Set clear goals and objectives for the KPI, such as reducing turnover rate by 10% within the next 6 months.
2. Establish a system for tracking and measuring the KPI, such as regular employee surveys and turnover rate tracking.
3. Provide training and resources to the leader to help them improve their conflict resolution skills and strategies.
4. Regularly review and evaluate the KPI with the leader to identify areas for improvement and provide feedback.
5. Use the KPI as a basis for bonuses or other incentives to motivate the leader to improve their conflict resolution skills and strategies.

By incorporating this KPI into the overall evaluation of the leader's performance, organizations can ensure that they are holding their leaders accountable for preventing and resolving conflicts in the workplace, and that they are taking proactive steps to create a positive and productive work environment.","['https://www.allvoices.co/blog/kpis-for-employee-relations', 'https://finmodelslab.com/blogs/kpi-metrics/conflict-management-consultancy-kpi-metrics', 'https://www.linkedin.com/advice/0/how-do-you-create-culture-constructive', 'https://finmodelslab.com/blogs/kpi-metrics/conflict-resolution-consulting-kpi-metrics', 'https://www.aihr.com/blog/employee-performance-metrics/', 'https://negotiations.ninja/blog/the-role-of-conflict-resolution-courses-in-building-a-harmonious-workplace/', 'https://www.jesansorrells.com/strategy-kpis-for-managing-workplace-conflict/', 'https://flevy.com/topic/conflict-management/question/effective-conflict-management-kpis-organizational-success-measurement', 'https://www.ache.org/blog/2023/nurturing-harmony-in-healthcare', 'https://www.assessteam.com/team-kpi-list/', 'https://www.allvoices.co/blog/kpis-for-employee-relations', 'https://www.aihr.com/blog/employee-performance-metrics/', 'https://finmodelslab.com/blogs/kpi-metrics/conflict-management-consultancy-kpi-metrics', 'https://www.clearpointstrategy.com/blog/18-key-performance-indicators', 'https://finmodelslab.com/blogs/kpi-metrics/conflict-resolution-consulting-kpi-metrics', 'https://www.clearpointstrategy.com/blog/important-project-management-kpis', 'https://flevy.com/topic/conflict-management/question/effective-conflict-management-kpis-organizational-success-measurement', 'https://hbr.org/2023/01/to-make-lasting-progress-on-dei-measure-outcomes', 'https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/truth-kpis-other-corporate-bullsht-liz-ryan', 'https://www.jesansorrells.com/strategy-kpis-for-managing-workplace-conflict/', 'https://www.allvoices.co/blog/kpis-for-employee-relations', 'https://www.aihr.com/blog/employee-performance-metrics/', 'https://finmodelslab.com/blogs/kpi-metrics/conflict-management-consultancy-kpi-metrics', 'https://www.clearpointstrategy.com/blog/18-key-performance-indicators', 'https://finmodelslab.com/blogs/kpi-metrics/conflict-resolution-consulting-kpi-metrics', 'https://www.clearpointstrategy.com/blog/important-project-management-kpis', 'https://flevy.com/topic/conflict-management/question/effective-conflict-management-kpis-organizational-success-measurement', 'https://hbr.org/2023/01/to-make-lasting-progress-on-dei-measure-outcomes', 'https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/truth-kpis-other-corporate-bullsht-liz-ryan', 'https://www.jesansorrells.com/strategy-kpis-for-managing-workplace-conflict/']",politics

6. Lead with the what, not the why: Focus on the what of the change, rather than the why, to avoid getting bogged down in unnecessary details.
7. Don't use HR speak: Avoid using jargon and technical terms that may confuse team members.
8. Appoint someone to lead the change: Appoint a leader to oversee the change and provide guidance and support to team members.
9. Provide training and support: Provide training and support to team members to help them adapt to the change.

How to develop decision-making skills?
The best way of honing decision-making skills is by experiencing and studying situations where decisions have gone wrong. People learn more often from the mistakes that they have committed rather than from the success that they have achieved.
8. Political Skills
It is a fact that all organizations or groups at their core are full of workplace politics. To move ahead, people attempt to gain allies, break the rules and push forward their agendas. An effective leader is also a good player politically, has knowledge regarding the rules that need to be followed for playing the game, and can manage political behavior to prevent it from resulting in the dysfunction of the group or the organization.

9. Influence Skills
Leadership, at its core, is all about influencing other people’s behavior. Therefore, a great leader is someone who is a master of social influence and can wield power fairly and effectively. You can become all the more influential in the leadership role if you can develop interpersonal or soft skills.
How to develop Influence Skills?
Reasoned and well-thought-out arguments are useful after getting trained in debating. Viewing things from the perspective of the other person may assist you in understanding what the things expected by them from negotiation are. This will let you focus on a situation that is a win-win.
10. Area Competence / Expertise
In today’s age, the significance of knowledge in every aspect of jobs is less important than it was. In creative firms or high-tech industries, the team members might possess more relevant knowledge and expertise than the leaders. Still, leaders must develop expertise in particular situations, industries, or organizations where they are in leadership roles.
How to develop Area Competencies?
Development is a lifelong process, similar to all the other competencies. You need to study the organization and also study the competitors of the organization. Effective leaders gain competence and expertise and attempt to gain as much knowledge as possible regarding their organization, product, and team members.
Apart from the above-mentioned competencies, leaders should also possess the competencies of agility, speed, passion, and focus to succeed. Such skills, however, cannot be taught. If an organization requires and supports these leadership competencies as a basis of its success, they must be instilled through an embedded system of leadership development. The success of such a program is dependent on five crucial factors, which include the –
- Support provided by the Executive Leadership
- Challenging work assignments
- The right people
- The supportive environment of work
- Instead of a course for skills, there should be a Leadership Development System.",Question: How can an organization create a culture that encourages leaders to take calculated risks and develop their courage?,"To create a culture that encourages leaders to take calculated risks and develop their courage, an organization must first understand the importance of risk-taking and its benefits.

"Fortitude or courage is another cardinal virtue. This includes the courage to take calculated risks, stand up for your beliefs, and do the right things.
How to develop courage?
Its roots lie in the development and the holding of strong personal values. If you value someone or something sincerely, you will possess the courage to stand up for your principles and your people.
6. Conflict Management
This “higher order” interpersonal skill helps colleagues avoid or resolve conflicts. When the members of an organization are in conflict with each other, the leaders are generally called upon to adjudicate. However, the ability to either avoid or resolve conflict situations is also involved in this.
How to Develop Conflict Management Skills?
Courses and workshops are available to assist you in understanding and learning conflict management strategies. A vital aspect of conflict management with respect to leadership competencies is to help the parties involved in the conflict to compromise (wherein each party should have the flexibility of giving up something) or collaborate (a win-win outcome).

"President Jackson argued in the early 19th century that any reasonably intelligent citizen could perform the duties of public office. During his time America was a pre-industrial society, therefore this notion might have been true. In the more complex age of the early twentieth century it became apparent that many functions of the government required expert specialists. This principle was echoed by progressive governor Robert Lafayette of Wisconsin (1901-1906). He established a collative Reference Bureau to provide research, advice, and help in drafting legislation.
This Bureau became known as the Wisconsin Idea of efficient government, and it became widely publicized and copied during the progressive era. Lafayette also pushed for conservation of natural resources, tighter OR regulation, and workmen’s compensation. Throughout the period many states, such as Georgia, California, and Alabama, elected progressive governors. Additionally, numerous congressional, state, and local progressive officials were elected into office. Regulation: The regulation of large corporations engaged a greater diversity f reformers and elicited far more controversial solutions than any other issue of the Progressive era.
The problem of economic power and abuse offered a dilemma for Progressives. Four broad solutions were available at the time: 1) Laissez-Fairer economics, or letting businesses control their own destinies without government regulations, 2) adopting a socialist program of public ownership, 3) adopt a policy of trust-busting in the belief that restoring old fashion competition would prevent economic abuse, or 4) accept big business but regulate it to prevent abuses. In the end the trend was toward exultation of big business, although this led to another problem: Regulatory agencies often came under control of those they were supposed to regulate.

Consequently, they had an advantage over the officials who might be appointed to the Interstate Commerce Commission. Social Justice: a fourth feature of progressivism was the impulse toward social justice, which covered everything from private charity to campaigns against child labor or liquor. The Industrial and urban revolution made many live that the social evils that resulted extended beyond the reach of private charities and demanded the power of the state.
Consent intently, the best way to achieve social justice was through legislation. The National Child Labor Committee, organized in 1904, led a movement for laws banning the still widespread employment of young children. Another group, the National Consumers League, led by the ardent socialist Florence Kelley, led a crusade for the passage of legislation that regulated the hours of work for women, especially wives and mothers. Many states also outlawed night work and abort in dangerous occupations for both women and children.
Legislation to protect workers from accidents gained momentum following the Triangle Fire (191 1), and stricter building codes and factory inspections soon followed the disaster. Finally, the opposition to alcohol was an ideal cause to merge the older private ethics with the new social ethics of the period. Given the moral disrepute of saloons, many prohibitionists equated the liquor traffic with the evils of machine politics, prostitution, and other urban problems. The prohibitionist movement dated as far back as 1874, with the Women’s Christian Temperance Union.
The most successful political action, however, came with the Anti-Saloon League, founded in 1893. This organization was one of the first single-issue lobbyist groups of the time.

"President Jackson argued in the early 19th century that any reasonably intelligent citizen could perform the duties of public office. During his time America was a pre-industrial society, therefore this notion might have been true. In the more complex age of the early twentieth century it became apparent that many functions of the government required expert specialists. This principle was echoed by progressive governor Robert Lafayette of Wisconsin (1901-1906). He established a collative Reference Bureau to provide research, advice, and help in drafting legislation.
This Bureau became known as the Wisconsin Idea of efficient government, and it became widely publicized and copied during the progressive era. Lafayette also pushed for conservation of natural resources, tighter OR regulation, and workmen’s compensation. Throughout the period many states, such as Georgia, California, and Alabama, elected progressive governors. Additionally, numerous congressional, state, and local progressive officials were elected into office. Regulation: The regulation of large corporations engaged a greater diversity f reformers and elicited far more controversial solutions than any other issue of the Progressive era.
The problem of economic power and abuse offered a dilemma for Progressives. Four broad solutions were available at the time: 1) Laissez-Fairer economics, or letting businesses control their own destinies without government regulations, 2) adopting a socialist program of public ownership, 3) adopt a policy of trust-busting in the belief that restoring old fashion competition would prevent economic abuse, or 4) accept big business but regulate it to prevent abuses. In the end the trend was toward exultation of big business, although this led to another problem: Regulatory agencies often came under control of those they were supposed to regulate.
OR leaders, for instance, generally had a more intimate knowledge of the intricacies of their business. Consequently, they had an advantage over the officials who might be appointed to the Interstate Commerce Commission. Social Justice: a fourth feature of progressivism was the impulse toward social justice, which covered everything from private charity to campaigns against child labor or liquor. The Industrial and urban revolution made many live that the social evils that resulted extended beyond the reach of private charities and demanded the power of the state.
Consent intently, the best way to achieve social justice was through legislation. The National Child Labor Committee, organized in 1904, led a movement for laws banning the still widespread employment of young children. Another group, the National Consumers League, led by the ardent socialist Florence Kelley, led a crusade for the passage of legislation that regulated the hours of work for women, especially wives and mothers. Many states also outlawed night work and abort in dangerous occupations for both women and children.
Legislation to protect workers from accidents gained momentum following the Triangle Fire (191 1), and stricter building codes and factory inspections soon followed the disaster. Finally, the opposition to alcohol was an ideal cause to merge the older private ethics with the new social ethics of the period. Given the moral disrepute of saloons, many prohibitionists equated the liquor traffic with the evils of machine politics, prostitution, and other urban problems. The prohibitionist movement dated as far back as 1874, with the Women’s Christian Temperance Union.
The most successful political action, however, came with the Anti-Saloon League, founded in 1893. This organization was one of the first single-issue lobbyist groups of the time. By singleness of purpose the group was able to force the liquor issue into the forefront of local and state elections. In 1913 the SSL held its Jubilee Convention, where it endorsed a prohibition amendment to the constitution. As we’ll see later, the prohibition amendment was ratified in 1919. Education, Consumerism, and Public Health: The progressive movement brought new ways of looking at the issues of the day.

The Progressive era's focus on social justice led to the development of environmental policies that addressed issues such as conservation, pollution, and public health. The era also saw the establishment of government agencies and programs dedicated to environmental protection, such as the U.S. Forest Service and the Federal Trade Commission.

"The movement had many causes, most notably the Depression of the 1 sass and the Populist movement In fact, a Kansas editor referred to Progressivism as “populism that had shaved its whiskers, washed its shirt, put on a derby, and moved up into the middle class. ” The Progressive Era, the years 1895-1920, was an idealistic period, one that focused on constructive social, economic, and political change.
Progressives believed that the complex social ills and tensions generated by the urban- industrial revolution required expanding the scope of local, state, and federal government authority. This, they believed, would ensure the progress of American society. The progressive movement refers to the common spirit Of an age rather than to an organized group or party. Progressivism was so diverse in its origins and intentions that few people adhered to all of its principles.
Nevertheless, Progressivism became one of the central elements of American liberalism, and the legislation and initiatives of the period lay the first steps for what would become in the 1 9305 the Welfare state. Antecedents to Progressivism: 1) Populism: Populism was undoubtedly the impetus for the growth of Progressivism. The Omaha Platform of 1892 outlined many of the reforms that would later be accomplished during the Progressive Era. 2) Mumps: this group supplied Progressives with an important element of its thinking: the honest government.
The new problems that arose in urban areas, such as crime, and efficient provision of water, electricity, sewage, and garbage collection, led to a growing number of elected officials with this new outlook toward honesty and efficiency. 3) Socialism: the Socialist Party of the time served as the left wing of progressivism. The growing familiarity with socialist doctrine and its critique of urban living and working conditions became a significant force in fostering the spirit of progressivism.
Nevertheless, most progressives could not stomach the remedies offered by socialists, and the Progressive reform impulse grew in part from a desire to counter the growing influence of socialist doctrine. 4) Muckrakers: social critics, usually writers, who thrived on exposing scandal. These people got their name when Teddy Roosevelt imparted them to a character in a book called Pilgrim’s Progress: “a man that could look no way but downwards with a muckrake in his hands. ” Roosevelt believed that the muckrakers are often indispensable to society, but only if they knew when to stop raking the muck.
The chief outlets for these social critics were the inexpensive magazines that began to flourish in the asses, such as Arena and McClure. The golden age of muckraking is sometimes dated from 1 902 when McClure began to run articles by reporter Lincoln Stiffens on municipal corruption. The articles were later compiled into a kook, published in 1904, called The Shame of the Cities. Other works that began as magazine articles exposed corruption in the stock market, life insurance, the meat industry, and politics.
The Features of Progressivism: Democracy: the most important reform with which the Progressives tried to democratic government was the Direct Primary, or the nomination of candidates by the vote of party members. Under the existing convention system, only a small percentage of the voters attended the local caucuses or precinct meetings which sent delegates to county, state, and national elections. This allowed the rise of professional politicians who stayed in office for extremely long periods of time.
In 1896 South Carolina adopted the first statewide primary, and within two decades this system had been implemented by nearly all states for Senators and congressmen. Finally, the Seventeenth Amendment, ratified in 191 3, authorized the direct election of senators by popular vote. The primary system was but one expression of a broad movement for direct democracy. During the period many states passed the Initiative, Referendum, and Recall. The initiative, first passed in 898 in South Dakota, provided the opportunity for citizens to create legislation by getting a set number of signatures on a petition.
The electorate would then vote the issue up or down, this being the referendum. The recall provided the opportunity to remove officials by petition and vote. Efficiency: A second major theme of progressivism was the “gospel of efficiency. ” In government, efficiency demanded the reorganization of agencies to prevent overlapping, to establish clear lines of authority, and to fix responsibility. Progressives believed that voters could make wiser choices f they had a shorter ballot and chose fewer officials in whom power and responsibility were lodged.","How did the rise of consumer culture in the early 20th century influence the types of social ills that Muckrakers focused on in their exposés, and what were the implications of this shift for the Progressive movement as a whole?",The rise of consumer culture in the early 20th century likely had a significant impact on the types of social ills that Muckrakers focused on in their exposés.,"['https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/us-history/rise-to-world-power/age-of-empire/a/muckrakers', 'https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/hine-photos', 'https://www.loc.gov/classroom-materials/united-states-history-primary-source-timeline/progressive-era-to-new-era-1900-1929/overview/', 'https://www.americanyawp.com/text/20-the-progressive-era/', 'https://www.history.com/news/upton-sinclair-the-jungle-us-food-safety-reforms', 'https://nerdfighteria.info/v/i0Q4zPR4G7M/', 'https://himes.house.gov/_cache/files/5/a/5a60990d-1f35-4764-8877-37c58a7d9a20/07094705142D4EF70AD3F1A5D46A6879.scedfg-report.pdf', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Era', 'https://www.oldwestbury.edu/office-registrar/catalogs/courses-discontinued-and-other-programs', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muckraker', 'https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/us-history/rise-to-world-power/age-of-empire/a/muckrakers', 'https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/hine-photos', 'https://www.loc.gov/classroom-materials/united-states-history-primary-source-timeline/progressive-era-to-new-era-1900-1929/overview/', 'https://www.americanyawp.com/text/20-the-progressive-era/', 'https://www.history.com/news/upton-sinclair-the-jungle-us-food-safety-reforms', 'https://nerdfighteria.info/v/i0Q4zPR4G7M/', 'https://himes.house.gov/_cache/files/5/a/5a60990d-1f35-4764-8877-37c58a7d9a20/07094705142D4EF70AD3F1A5D46A6879.scedfg-report.pdf', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Era', 'https://www.oldwestbury.edu/office-registrar/catalogs/courses-discontinued-and-other-programs', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muckraker', 'https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/us-history/rise-to-world-power/age-of-empire/a/muckrakers', 'https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/hine-photos', 'https://www.loc.gov/classroom-materials/united-states-history-primary-source-timeline/progressive-era-to-new-era-1900-1929/overview/', 'https://www.americanyawp.com/text/20-the-progressive-era/', 'https://www.history.com/news/upton-sinclair-the-jungle-us-food-safety-reforms', 'https://nerdfighteria.info/v/i0Q4zPR4G7M/', 'https://himes.house.gov/_cache/files/5/a/5a60990d-1f35-4764-8877-37c58a7d9a20/07094705142D4EF70AD3F1A5D46A6879.scedfg-report.pdf', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Era', 'https://www.oldwestbury.edu/office-registrar/catalogs/courses-discontinued-and-other-programs', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muckraker']",politics

The golden age of muckraking is sometimes dated from 1 902 when McClure began to run articles by reporter Lincoln Stiffens on municipal corruption. The articles were later compiled into a kook, published in 1904, called The Shame of the Cities. Other works that began as magazine articles exposed corruption in the stock market, life insurance, the meat industry, and politics.
The Features of Progressivism: Democracy: the most important reform with which the Progressives tried to democratic government was the Direct Primary, or the nomination of candidates by the vote of party members. Under the existing convention system, only a small percentage of the voters attended the local caucuses or precinct meetings which sent delegates to county, state, and national elections. This allowed the rise of professional politicians who stayed in office for extremely long periods of time.
In 1896 South Carolina adopted the first statewide primary, and within two decades this system had been implemented by nearly all states for Senators and congressmen. Finally, the Seventeenth Amendment, ratified in 191 3, authorized the direct election of senators by popular vote. The primary system was but one expression of a broad movement for direct democracy. During the period many states passed the Initiative, Referendum, and Recall. The initiative, first passed in 898 in South Dakota, provided the opportunity for citizens to create legislation by getting a set number of signatures on a petition.
The electorate would then vote the issue up or down, this being the referendum. The recall provided the opportunity to remove officials by petition and vote. Efficiency: A second major theme of progressivism was the “gospel of efficiency. ” In government, efficiency demanded the reorganization of agencies to prevent overlapping, to establish clear lines of authority, and to fix responsibility. Progressives believed that voters could make wiser choices f they had a shorter ballot and chose fewer officials in whom power and responsibility were lodged.","How did the rise of negative campaigning in the 20th century influence the way voters made decisions in primary elections, and what were the implications for the democratic process as a whole?","The rise of negative campaigning in the 20th century had a profound impact on the way voters made decisions in primary elections, and its implications for the democratic process as a whole are multifaceted.

The rise of negative campaigning in the 20th century has been a significant phenomenon that has influenced the way voters make decisions in primary elections. Negative campaigning has been shown to have a negative impact on voter turnout, with some studies suggesting that it can lead to voter disaffection and lower turnout. Additionally, negative campaigning can also distort political discourse, lead to polarization and party system fragmentation, and promote political cynicism.

On the other hand, some studies have suggested that negative campaigning can also have a positive impact on voter decisions, such as increasing voter awareness and mobilization. However, these effects are often short-term and may not be sustainable in the long term.

The implications of negative campaigning for the democratic process are also multifaceted. On the one hand, negative campaigning can undermine trust in political institutions and lead to a decline in civic engagement. On the other hand, negative campaigning can also provide a platform for voters to engage with political issues and hold politicians accountable.

Overall, the rise of negative campaigning in the 20th century has had a profound impact on the way voters make decisions in primary elections, and its implications for the democratic process are complex and multifaceted.","['https://www.vanderbilt.edu/csdi/research/CSDI_WP_2-2012.pdf', 'https://www.jfklibrary.org/learn/about-jfk/jfk-in-history/campaign-of-1960', 'https://www.elon.edu/u/imagining/time-capsule/150-years/back-1920-1960/', 'https://www.coe.int/en/web/campaign-free-to-speak-safe-to-learn/dealing-with-propaganda-misinformation-and-fake-news', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10078752/', 'https://www.brookings.edu/articles/a-short-history-of-campaign-dirty-tricks-before-twitter-and-facebook/', 'https://www.accc.gov.au/system/files/ACCC+commissioned+report+-+The+impact+of+digital+platforms+on+news+and+journalistic+content,+Centre+for+Media+Transition+(2).pdf', 'https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/fact-sheets/Eugenics-and-Scientific-Racism', 'https://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/Letter_Birmingham.html', 'https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/publications/techrpt83_Global_and_Regional_SLR_Scenarios_for_the_US_final.pdf', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10078752/', 'https://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/how-much-do-campaign-ads-matter', 'https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41253-019-00084-8', 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00522.x', 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00913367.1993.10673419', 'https://digitalcommons.iwu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1193&context=respublica', 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00913367.2002.10673657', 'https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2023/09/19/americans-dismal-views-of-the-nations-politics/', 'https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1940161218803426', 'https://www.americanbar.org/groups/crsj/publications/human_rights_magazine_home/voting-in-2020/political-advertising-on-social-media-platforms/', 'https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2021/653635/EXPO_STU(2021)653635_EN.pdf', 'https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41253-019-00084-8', 'https://www.americanbar.org/groups/crsj/publications/human_rights_magazine_home/voting-in-2020/political-advertising-on-social-media-platforms/', 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08838159009386744', 'https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/do-negative-campaigns-mobilize-or-suppress-turnout-clarifying-the-relationship-between-negativity-and-participation/103A17FDD0F0031D665687C7B689F371', 'https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2023/09/19/americans-dismal-views-of-the-nations-politics/', 'https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1081180X04271861', 'https://news.wisc.edu/negative-campaign-ads-contribute-to-a-healthy-democracy-political-scientist-argues/', 'https://ecpr.eu/Events/Event/PaperDetails/37366', 'https://scholar.archive.org/work/wkpjz24byzcihhg3twf3qrsa6m/access/wayback/http://apsaproceedings.cup.org:80/Site/papers/036/036016CriglerAnn.pdf']",politics
"The workload of the Election Commission will be evenly distributed over a period of 5 years (60 months) instead of over 2/3 months. In this scenario, the requirement for EVMs and other peripheral equipment will be reduced by a factor of 25-30. No additional EVMs/ VVPAT machines will be required for the 2024 poll – the stock currently available is estimated to have cost INR 2,000 crore.
Indeed, a lot of what we have can be sold or even gifted to democracies in our neighbourhood as a gesture of goodwill. For the 2024 Simultaneous Poll, it has been estimated that we will need new units, costing an estimated INR 14,000 crore; with staggered elections, this will shrink to INR 500 crore.
There are several reforms that can be considered, as funds will now be available.
i) At present we have about 10,00,000 (ten lakh) polling stations – each one equipped to handle, in theory, about 800-1,000 voters. This is not enough, as the long queues currently seen at polling stations, comprising people waiting for an hour or more, testify. What we need is one polling station per 500 voters. A voter presenting herself at a polling station should be out in less than 5 minutes, having voted successfully. To do this, the cost of staggered elections will go up to INR 1,000 crore, which is still insignificant compared to the INR 14,000 crore that would have to be set aside for simultaneous (without the staggering of poll dates) elections.
ii) Another weakness of the ECI is that it is almost entirely dependent on the staff on loan from the local administration for conducting elections. And with the seasonal nature of its work, there is no alternative. But once the work is perennial, this need not be so. The ECI can have its own staff, highly trained and dedicated, and completely free from potentially parochial political influence. The need for borrowed staff, with limited powers, for the duration of election in a particular section, will be relatively minimal. This can be done by creating an Indian Election Service, answerable only to the President, through the Chief Election Commissioner. All responsibilities and accounting of the entire staffing operation can be and should be segregated and isolated from the usual executive line of command.
iii) The proposed funding of candidates, hanging fire for ages due to lack of funds, can be implemented now. Only the modalities to ensure its just and fair distribution needs to be agreed upon. The present system, that allows political parties to muster up concealed resources for candidates, can be eliminated. The recent introduction of anonymised funding through electoral bonds has hugely distorted electoral politics and tips the odds massively against independent representatives. This scheme can be shut down once candidate funding is set up.
iv) The monthly results of elections will serve as a bellwether to policymakers, and the ruling party will be called upon to show progress reports continuously, and not every five years, by which time memories of serious breaches of trust and accountability have dimmed. Another advantage is that the timing of the election in each area can be chosen in accordance with that area’s climate. This will further ease the burden of voting itself on the electorate, whose polling numbers have never been sufficient to demonstrate that the nation is politically engaged.
The Nemesis of History
The experience of the Emergency, declared in 1975, should be a lesson when amending the Constitution to modify national institutions. Luckily, there was almost no violence at the time, the armed forces remained distant from civilian matters, and normalcy was soon restored. But it must be ensured that such a thing never happens again.
With Simultaneous Staggered Elections, the legacy of dissolution of the Parliament, and the possibility of mid-term elections will be put to rest. The Parliament will become a continuing entity, with members retiring after their five year term, substituted by newly elected members. This is a major change in the manner of conduct of a parliamentary democracy, with enormous potential to eliminate significant ills of incumbency and accumulation of power. It restores the ability to effectively build the Parliament itself into a functioning electoral college, which could make the government in power far more accountable, as its continuance will be dependent on its ability to win votes on Bills proposed by the ruling party. In turn, this raises the possibility that Bills proposed by non-ruling parties or independents are treated on their merits, professionalising the functioning of the Houses of Parliament and minimising the ills of partisan politics interfering with governance.","How could the Election Commission of India ensure that the voter registration and electoral roll updates are accurate and reflect the actual demographic changes in a constituency, while also minimizing the opportunities for fraudulent registrations?",The Election Commission of India can ensure accurate voter registration and electoral roll updates by implementing a robust system that verifies demographic changes in a constituency while minimizing opportunities for fraudulent registrations.,"['https://elections.maryland.gov/', 'https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/voter-registration-list-maintenance', 'https://www.elections.virginia.gov/', 'https://www.justice.gov/crt/title-52-voting-and-elections-subtitle-i-and-ii', 'https://www.eci.gov.in/evm-faq-new', 'https://www.voteindianriver.gov/', 'https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legacy/publications/Expanding.Democracy.pdf', 'https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-electronic-voting-machines-have-improved-indias-democracy/', 'https://sos.tn.gov/elections/guides/how-to-update-your-voter-registration', 'https://elections24.eci.gov.in/', 'https://elections.maryland.gov/', 'https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/voter-registration-list-maintenance', 'https://www.elections.virginia.gov/', 'https://www.justice.gov/crt/title-52-voting-and-elections-subtitle-i-and-ii', 'https://www.eci.gov.in/evm-faq-new', 'https://www.voteindianriver.gov/', 'https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legacy/publications/Expanding.Democracy.pdf', 'https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-electronic-voting-machines-have-improved-indias-democracy/', 'https://sos.tn.gov/elections/guides/how-to-update-your-voter-registration', 'https://elections24.eci.gov.in/']",politics

For the 2024 Simultaneous Poll, it has been estimated that we will need new units, costing an estimated INR 14,000 crore; with staggered elections, this will shrink to INR 500 crore.
There are several reforms that can be considered, as funds will now be available.
i) At present we have about 10,00,000 (ten lakh) polling stations – each one equipped to handle, in theory, about 800-1,000 voters. This is not enough, as the long queues currently seen at polling stations, comprising people waiting for an hour or more, testify. What we need is one polling station per 500 voters. A voter presenting herself at a polling station should be out in less than 5 minutes, having voted successfully. To do this, the cost of staggered elections will go up to INR 1,000 crore, which is still insignificant compared to the INR 14,000 crore that would have to be set aside for simultaneous (without the staggering of poll dates) elections.
ii) Another weakness of the ECI is that it is almost entirely dependent on the staff on loan from the local administration for conducting elections. And with the seasonal nature of its work, there is no alternative. But once the work is perennial, this need not be so. The ECI can have its own staff, highly trained and dedicated, and completely free from potentially parochial political influence. The need for borrowed staff, with limited powers, for the duration of election in a particular section, will be relatively minimal. This can be done by creating an Indian Election Service, answerable only to the President, through the Chief Election Commissioner. All responsibilities and accounting of the entire staffing operation can be and should be segregated and isolated from the usual executive line of command.
iii) The proposed funding of candidates, hanging fire for ages due to lack of funds, can be implemented now. Only the modalities to ensure its just and fair distribution needs to be agreed upon. The present system, that allows political parties to muster up concealed resources for candidates, can be eliminated. The recent introduction of anonymised funding through electoral bonds has hugely distorted electoral politics and tips the odds massively against independent representatives. This scheme can be shut down once candidate funding is set up.
iv) The monthly results of elections will serve as a bellwether to policymakers, and the ruling party will be called upon to show progress reports continuously, and not every five years, by which time memories of serious breaches of trust and accountability have dimmed. Another advantage is that the timing of the election in each area can be chosen in accordance with that area’s climate. This will further ease the burden of voting itself on the electorate, whose polling numbers have never been sufficient to demonstrate that the nation is politically engaged.
The Nemesis of History
The experience of the Emergency, declared in 1975, should be a lesson when amending the Constitution to modify national institutions. Luckily, there was almost no violence at the time, the armed forces remained distant from civilian matters, and normalcy was soon restored. But it must be ensured that such a thing never happens again.
With Simultaneous Staggered Elections, the legacy of dissolution of the Parliament, and the possibility of mid-term elections will be put to rest. The Parliament will become a continuing entity, with members retiring after their five year term, substituted by newly elected members. This is a major change in the manner of conduct of a parliamentary democracy, with enormous potential to eliminate significant ills of incumbency and accumulation of power. It restores the ability to effectively build the Parliament itself into a functioning electoral college, which could make the government in power far more accountable, as its continuance will be dependent on its ability to win votes on Bills proposed by the ruling party. In turn, this raises the possibility that Bills proposed by non-ruling parties or independents are treated on their merits, professionalising the functioning of the Houses of Parliament and minimising the ills of partisan politics interfering with governance.","How might the reduction in election-related expenses due to staggered polls impact the allocation of resources in the Indian government's budget, and what could be the potential consequences for the economy and public services?","The reduction in election-related expenses due to staggered polls could have a significant impact on the allocation of resources in the Indian government's budget, leading to potential consequences for the economy and public services.","['https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261379420300895', 'https://time.com/6958093/india-elections-2024-phases-long/', 'https://www.senate.gov/about/origins-foundations/senate-and-constitution.htm', 'https://www.justice.gov/crt/title-52-voting-and-elections-subtitle-i-and-ii', 'https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/16/india-announces-election-2024-seven-numbers-to-unpack-worlds-biggest-vote', 'https://www.fec.gov/help-candidates-and-committees/candidate-taking-receipts/types-contributions/', 'https://www.nea.org/nea-today/all-news-articles/survey-alarming-number-educators-may-soon-leave-profession', 'https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/imf-and-covid19/Policy-Responses-to-COVID-19', 'https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/05/do-governments-manipulate-fiscal-policy-to-win-elections/', 'https://www.cms.gov/data-research/statistics-trends-and-reports/national-health-expenditure-data/nhe-fact-sheet', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261379420300895', 'https://time.com/6958093/india-elections-2024-phases-long/', 'https://www.senate.gov/about/origins-foundations/senate-and-constitution.htm', 'https://www.justice.gov/crt/title-52-voting-and-elections-subtitle-i-and-ii', 'https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/16/india-announces-election-2024-seven-numbers-to-unpack-worlds-biggest-vote', 'https://www.fec.gov/help-candidates-and-committees/candidate-taking-receipts/types-contributions/', 'https://www.nea.org/nea-today/all-news-articles/survey-alarming-number-educators-may-soon-leave-profession', 'https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/imf-and-covid19/Policy-Responses-to-COVID-19', 'https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/05/do-governments-manipulate-fiscal-policy-to-win-elections/', 'https://www.cms.gov/data-research/statistics-trends-and-reports/national-health-expenditure-data/nhe-fact-sheet', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261379420300895', 'https://time.com/6958093/india-elections-2024-phases-long/', 'https://www.senate.gov/about/origins-foundations/senate-and-constitution.htm', 'https://www.justice.gov/crt/title-52-voting-and-elections-subtitle-i-and-ii', 'https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/16/india-announces-election-2024-seven-numbers-to-unpack-worlds-biggest-vote', 'https://www.fec.gov/help-candidates-and-committees/candidate-taking-receipts/types-contributions/', 'https://www.nea.org/nea-today/all-news-articles/survey-alarming-number-educators-may-soon-leave-profession', 'https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/imf-and-covid19/Policy-Responses-to-COVID-19', 'https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/05/do-governments-manipulate-fiscal-policy-to-win-elections/', 'https://www.cms.gov/data-research/statistics-trends-and-reports/national-health-expenditure-data/nhe-fact-sheet']",politics

1 Debroy, Bibek & Desai, Kishore: ANALYSIS OF SIMULTANEOUS ELECTIONS : THE “WHAT”, “WHY” AND “HOW” A Discussion Paper","How can the staggered election system be designed to ensure that elected representatives are more responsive to their constituents, given the inherent limitations of the traditional parliamentary system, without compromising the stability of the government?","To design a staggered election system that ensures elected representatives are more responsive to their constituents, while maintaining government stability, we can consider the following perspectives and strategies:

1. Implement a mixed-member proportional representation system, where a portion of representatives are elected through proportional representation and the remaining through single-member districts. This can increase the representation of diverse voices and perspectives, while maintaining the stability of the government.

2. Implement a system of term limits, where representatives are limited to a certain number of terms in office. This can help to prevent the accumulation of power and promote accountability.

3. Implement a system of recall elections, where constituents can vote to remove a representative from office if they are not meeting their expectations. This can help to hold representatives accountable and ensure that they are responsive to their constituents.

4. Implement a system of citizen-initiated legislation, where citizens can propose and vote on legislation. This can help to increase citizen engagement and ensure that representatives are responsive to their constituents' needs and concerns.

5. Implement a system of regular town hall meetings and public hearings, where representatives can engage with their constituents and hear their concerns. This can help to increase transparency and accountability.

6. Implement a system of independent redistricting commissions, where a non-partisan commission is responsible for drawing district boundaries. This can help to reduce the influence of special interests and ensure that district boundaries are fair and representative.

7. Implement a system of campaign finance reform, where limits are placed on campaign contributions and spending. This can help to reduce the influence of special interests and ensure that representatives are responsive to their constituents.

8. Implement a system of voter registration and turnout initiatives, where efforts are made to increase voter registration and turnout. This can help to increase citizen engagement and ensure that representatives are responsive to their constituents.

9. Implement a system of independent ethics commissions, where a non-partisan commission is responsible for investigating and addressing ethics violations. This can help to increase transparency and accountability.

10. Implement a system of regular performance evaluations, where representatives are evaluated on their performance and held accountable for their actions. This can help to increase accountability and ensure that representatives are responsive to their constituents.

By implementing these strategies, a staggered election system can be designed that ensures elected representatives are more responsive to their constituents, while maintaining government stability.","['https://www.senate.gov/about/origins-foundations/senate-and-constitution.htm', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7299200/', 'http://walberg.house.gov/about/how-congress-works', 'https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/fedexplained/who-we-are.htm', 'https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/RS21574.html', 'https://www.dhs.gov/topics/cybersecurity', 'https://www.americanprogress.org/article/distorted-districts-distorted-laws/', 'https://www.justice.gov/crt/title-52-voting-and-elections-subtitle-i-and-ii', 'https://www.dhs.gov/archive/change-underway-dhs-foia', 'https://www.congress.gov/117/crpt/CRPT-117hrpt646/GPO-CRPT-117hrpt646.pdf?', 'https://www.senate.gov/about/origins-foundations/senate-and-constitution.htm', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7299200/', 'http://walberg.house.gov/about/how-congress-works', 'https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/fedexplained/who-we-are.htm', 'https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/RS21574.html', 'https://www.dhs.gov/topics/cybersecurity', 'https://www.americanprogress.org/article/distorted-districts-distorted-laws/', 'https://www.justice.gov/crt/title-52-voting-and-elections-subtitle-i-and-ii', 'https://www.dhs.gov/archive/change-underway-dhs-foia', 'https://www.congress.gov/117/crpt/CRPT-117hrpt646/GPO-CRPT-117hrpt646.pdf?', 'https://www.senate.gov/about/origins-foundations/senate-and-constitution.htm', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7299200/', 'http://walberg.house.gov/about/how-congress-works', 'https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/fedexplained/who-we-are.htm', 'https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/RS21574.html', 'https://www.dhs.gov/topics/cybersecurity', 'https://www.americanprogress.org/article/distorted-districts-distorted-laws/', 'https://www.justice.gov/crt/title-52-voting-and-elections-subtitle-i-and-ii', 'https://www.dhs.gov/archive/change-underway-dhs-foia', 'https://www.congress.gov/117/crpt/CRPT-117hrpt646/GPO-CRPT-117hrpt646.pdf?']",politics

1 Debroy, Bibek & Desai, Kishore: ANALYSIS OF SIMULTANEOUS ELECTIONS : THE “WHAT”, “WHY” AND “HOW” A Discussion Paper","What would be the implications on the stability of the government if a pro tem alternate were to assume powers in the event of the Prime Minister's sudden illness, and how would the President's role be affected in such a scenario, while also considering the checks and balances enshrined in the proposed system?","The implications on the stability of the government if a pro tem alternate were to assume powers in the event of the Prime Minister's sudden illness would depend on the specific constitutional and legal framework in place. In general, the assumption of powers by a pro tem alternate could lead to a temporary disruption in the normal functioning of the government, potentially causing instability and uncertainty.

In the event of the Prime Minister's sudden illness, the pro tem alternate would likely assume the powers and duties of the Prime Minister, including the responsibility of making key decisions and taking actions on behalf of the government. This could lead to a temporary power vacuum, potentially causing confusion and uncertainty among government officials, the public, and other stakeholders.

However, the stability of the government would also depend on the ability of the pro tem alternate to effectively assume the powers and duties of the Prime Minister, and to make decisions that are in the best interests of the country. If the pro tem alternate is able to do so, the assumption of powers could potentially lead to a smooth transition and a stable government.

In terms of the role of the President, the assumption of powers by a pro tem alternate would likely have implications for the President's role and responsibilities.

New York, 2003, Random House","How did the rise of the Midwest as a major agricultural region in the early 19th century influence the development of the American two-party system, and what role did the Virginia dynasty play in responding to this shift in power?","The rise of the Midwest as a major agricultural region in the early 19th century had a significant impact on the development of the American two-party system, particularly in terms of the influence of the Virginia dynasty. The Virginia dynasty, which included presidents such as James Monroe, John Quincy Adams, and Andrew Jackson, played a crucial role in shaping the country's political landscape during this period. The dynasty's influence was characterized by a strong emphasis on states' rights, limited government, and the protection of slavery, which ultimately contributed to the growth of sectionalism and the eventual division of the country.

The Virginia dynasty's response to the shift in power towards the Midwest was marked by a combination of resistance and accommodation. On one hand, the dynasty's leaders, such as Henry Clay and John Calhoun, sought to maintain the power and influence of the East Coast elite by promoting policies that favored the interests of the slave-holding South. On the other hand, they also recognized the growing importance of the Midwest and sought to incorporate its interests into their political agenda.

One of the key ways in which the Virginia dynasty responded to the shift in power was by promoting the development of infrastructure, such as canals and roads, that would connect the East Coast to the Midwest. This was seen as a way to facilitate trade and commerce between the two regions and to promote the growth of the national economy.

Another way in which the Virginia dynasty responded to the shift in power was by seeking to maintain the power and influence of the federal government. This was achieved through the passage of laws and policies that favored the interests of the East Coast elite, such as the Tariff of 1828, which protected the interests of northern manufacturers.

Overall, the Virginia dynasty's response to the shift in power towards the Midwest was marked by a combination of resistance and accommodation. While they sought to maintain the power and influence of the East Coast elite, they also recognized the growing importance of the Midwest and sought to incorporate its interests into their political agenda.","['https://www.archives.gov/files/legislative/resources/ebooks/two-party-system.pdf', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2760060/', 'https://www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/publications/manual/2001-2002/2001-mm-0003-0026-History.pdf', 'https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/homestead-act', 'https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/sde/social-studies/ssframeworks.pdf', 'http://emergingamerica.org/exhibits/steamboat-barnet/investigations/american-system', 'https://tea.texas.gov/student-assessment/testing/2022-staar-may-grade-8-socialstudies-releasedtest.pdf', 'https://www.rd.usda.gov/files/RR194.pdf', 'https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2018/05/22/demographic-and-economic-trends-in-urban-suburban-and-rural-communities/', 'https://digital.lib.niu.edu/illinois/gildedage/populism', 'https://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/2011-national-gang-threat-assessment', 'https://www.archives.gov/files/legislative/resources/ebooks/two-party-system.pdf', 'https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/hs/cf/documents/hssframeworkwhole.pdf', 'https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/report_volume5.pdf', 'https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/cr/cf/documents/histsocsciframe.pdf', 'https://www.anheuser-busch.com/careers', 'https://www.nps.gov/articles/carnegie-libraries-the-future-made-bright-teaching-with-historic-places.htm', 'https://www.baldwin.senate.gov/about/about-tammy', 'https://www.oregon.gov/osp/Docs/Vehicle_Codes.pdf', 'https://www.slam.org/explore-the-collection/object-of-the-day/']",politics

New York, 2003, Random House",How did the growing urbanization of the late 18th century affect the ability of the Federalist Party to maintain its electoral base and what were the consequences for the Republican Party's electoral strategy?,"The growing urbanization of the late 18th century had a significant impact on the Federalist Party's electoral base and the Republican Party's strategy. The Federalist Party, which was dominant in the early years of the United States, was heavily reliant on the support of the wealthy elite and the commercial interests of the cities. As urbanization increased, the Federalist Party's base of support began to erode, as the growing middle class and working class populations became more aligned with the Democratic-Republican Party, which was more sympathetic to their interests.

The Republican Party, on the other hand, was able to capitalize on the growing urbanization and industrialization of the late 18th century by appealing to the interests of the working class and the middle class. The party's platform, which emphasized the importance of individual liberty, limited government, and economic opportunity, resonated with the growing population of urban workers and small business owners.

In terms of specific electoral strategies, the Republican Party was able to use the growing urbanization to its advantage by targeting urban areas and appealing to the interests of the working class and the middle class. The party's candidates, such as Andrew Jackson and Martin Van Buren, were able to win support among urban voters by promising to reduce tariffs, promote economic development, and protect the interests of the working class.

In contrast, the Federalist Party's electoral strategy was based on maintaining the support of the wealthy elite and the commercial interests of the cities. The party's candidates, such as John Adams and Alexander Hamilton, were able to win support among the wealthy and the commercial interests by promising to maintain the status quo and protect the interests of the established elite.

Overall, the growing urbanization of the late 18th century had a significant impact on the electoral strategies of the Federalist and Republican Parties. The Republican Party was able to capitalize on the growing urbanization and industrialization by appealing to the interests of the working class and the middle class, while the Federalist Party's base of support began to erode as the growing middle class and working class populations became more aligned with the Democratic-Republican Party.","['https://tea.texas.gov/student-assessment/2021-staar-gr-8-social-studies-test-tagged.pdf', 'https://www.nrc.no/perspectives/2015/nr-4/colombias-bloody-history/', 'https://tea.texas.gov/student-assessment/testing/2023-staar-redesign-ushistory-practice-test.pdf', 'https://latinaer.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40503-019-0076-2', 'https://americanexperience.si.edu/historical-eras/colonization-revolution-and-new-nation/pair-daniel-lamotte-independence-squire-jack-porter/', 'https://www.nysed.gov/sites/default/files/programs/curriculum-instruction/ss-framework-k-8a2.pdf', 'https://www.britannica.com/topic/conservatism/Conservatism-in-the-19th-century', 'https://www.nysed.gov/sites/default/files/programs/curriculum-instruction/ss-framework-9-12.pdf', 'https://www.nlc.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Home-Rule-Principles-ReportWEB-2-1.pdf', 'https://ed.sc.gov/instruction/standards-learning/social-studies/resources/us-history-and-the-constitution-alignment-guide-28-august-2019/', 'https://tea.texas.gov/student-assessment/2021-staar-gr-8-social-studies-test-tagged.pdf', 'https://www.nrc.no/perspectives/2015/nr-4/colombias-bloody-history/', 'https://tea.texas.gov/student-assessment/testing/2023-staar-redesign-ushistory-practice-test.pdf', 'https://latinaer.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40503-019-0076-2', 'https://americanexperience.si.edu/historical-eras/colonization-revolution-and-new-nation/pair-daniel-lamotte-independence-squire-jack-porter/', 'https://www.nysed.gov/sites/default/files/programs/curriculum-instruction/ss-framework-k-8a2.pdf', 'https://www.britannica.com/topic/conservatism/Conservatism-in-the-19th-century', 'https://www.nysed.gov/sites/default/files/programs/curriculum-instruction/ss-framework-9-12.pdf', 'https://www.nlc.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Home-Rule-Principles-ReportWEB-2-1.pdf', 'https://ed.sc.gov/instruction/standards-learning/social-studies/resources/us-history-and-the-constitution-alignment-guide-28-august-2019/', 'https://tea.texas.gov/student-assessment/2021-staar-gr-8-social-studies-test-tagged.pdf', 'https://www.nrc.no/perspectives/2015/nr-4/colombias-bloody-history/', 'https://tea.texas.gov/student-assessment/testing/2023-staar-redesign-ushistory-practice-test.pdf', 'https://latinaer.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40503-019-0076-2', 'https://americanexperience.si.edu/historical-eras/colonization-revolution-and-new-nation/pair-daniel-lamotte-independence-squire-jack-porter/', 'https://www.nysed.gov/sites/default/files/programs/curriculum-instruction/ss-framework-k-8a2.pdf', 'https://www.britannica.com/topic/conservatism/Conservatism-in-the-19th-century', 'https://www.nysed.gov/sites/default/files/programs/curriculum-instruction/ss-framework-9-12.pdf', 'https://www.nlc.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Home-Rule-Principles-ReportWEB-2-1.pdf', 'https://ed.sc.gov/instruction/standards-learning/social-studies/resources/us-history-and-the-constitution-alignment-guide-28-august-2019/', 'https://www.lamoncloa.gob.es/lang/en/espana/historyandculture/history/Paginas/index.aspx', 'https://tea.texas.gov/student-assessment/testing/2023-staar-redesign-ushistory-practice-test.pdf', 'https://www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/publications/manual/2001-2002/2001-mm-0003-0026-History.pdf', 'https://tea.texas.gov/student-assessment/2021-staar-gr-8-social-studies-test-tagged.pdf', 'https://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/era.cfm?eraid=5&smtid=1', 'https://www.brookings.edu/articles/from-melting-pot-to-centrifuge-immigrants-and-american-politics/', 'http://www.maine.gov/sos/kids/about/history', 'https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/Newsroom/Reports%20and%20Pubs/2025_Global_Trends_Final_Report.pdf', 'https://fscj.pressbooks.pub/modernushistory/chapter/politics-in-the-gilded-age-1870-1900/', 'https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/us-history/the-gilded-age/gilded-age/a/politics-in-the-gilded-age']",politics

The tie between Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr in the Electoral College led to a re-evaluation of the presidential election process, ultimately resulting in the development of national party machinery and candidate selection processes that are more stable and predictable in the long run.

The election of 1800 revealed the need for a more formalized system of party organization and candidate selection. Prior to this election, political parties were loose coalitions of individuals who shared similar political beliefs. The tie vote between Jefferson and Burr highlighted the need for a more structured approach to party organization and candidate selection.

The development of national party machinery and candidate selection processes was influenced by several factors, including the growth of urbanization, the expansion of suffrage, and the increasing importance of party loyalty. The rise of national parties, such as the Democratic-Republican Party and the Federalist Party, provided a framework for candidate selection and party organization.

The 1800 presidential election also led to a re-evaluation of the Electoral College system. The tie vote between Jefferson and Burr highlighted the potential for future tie votes and the need for a more formalized system of electing the president. The 12th Amendment to the Constitution, ratified in 1804, established a more formalized system of electing the president and vice president.

In conclusion, the 1800 presidential election's influence on national party machinery and candidate selection processes is multifaceted and far-reaching. The tie between Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr led to a re-evaluation of the presidential election process, ultimately resulting in the development of national party machinery and candidate selection processes that are more stable and predictable in the long run.","['https://www.britannica.com/topic/political-machine', 'https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/election-administration-at-state-and-local-levels', 'https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/creating-the-united-states/formation-of-political-parties.html', 'https://billofrightsinstitute.org/essays/the-corrupt-bargain', 'https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/GlobalTrends_2040.pdf', 'https://www.monticello.org/research-education/thomas-jefferson-encyclopedia/election-1804/', 'https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/more-perfect-union', 'https://www.ada.gov/resources/disability-rights-guide/', 'https://www.fec.gov/introduction-campaign-finance/election-results-and-voting-information/', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_machine', 'https://www.usa.gov/electoral-college', 'https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/constitutional-amendments-amendment-12-electing-president-and-vice-president', 'https://www.loc.gov/classroom-materials/elections/presidential-election-process/political-primaries-how-are-candidates-nominated/', 'https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/a-brief-history-of-presidential-primaries', 'https://www.archives.gov/electoral-college/history', 'https://www.reuters.com/article/world/us-politics/how-selecting-us-presidential-candidates-became-the-peoples-choice-idUSKCN0WW000/', 'https://www.senate.gov/about/officers-staff/vice-president/senate-elects-vice-president.htm', 'https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/election-administration-at-state-and-local-levels', 'https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R40504/7', 'https://news.arizona.edu/news/does-vp-pick-change-race-probably-not-uarizona-expert-says', 'https://www.britannica.com/topic/political-machine', 'https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/election-administration-at-state-and-local-levels', 'https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/creating-the-united-states/formation-of-political-parties.html', 'https://billofrightsinstitute.org/essays/the-corrupt-bargain', 'https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/GlobalTrends_2040.pdf', 'https://www.monticello.org/research-education/thomas-jefferson-encyclopedia/election-1804/', 'https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/more-perfect-union', 'https://www.ada.gov/resources/disability-rights-guide/', 'https://www.fec.gov/introduction-campaign-finance/election-results-and-voting-information/', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_machine', 'https://www.britannica.com/topic/political-machine', 'https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/election-administration-at-state-and-local-levels', 'https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/creating-the-united-states/formation-of-political-parties.html', 'https://billofrightsinstitute.org/essays/the-corrupt-bargain', 'https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/GlobalTrends_2040.pdf', 'https://www.monticello.org/research-education/thomas-jefferson-encyclopedia/election-1804/', 'https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/more-perfect-union', 'https://www.ada.gov/resources/disability-rights-guide/', 'https://www.fec.gov/introduction-campaign-finance/election-results-and-voting-information/', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_machine']",politics

The industrial sector's growth and development created new economic and social opportunities, which in turn influenced the political landscape. The Federalist Party, which was traditionally associated with the interests of the established elite, began to decline as the Republican Party, which was more closely tied to the interests of the emerging industrial and commercial classes, gained popularity. The rise of the Republican Party was fueled by the growth of cities and the expansion of trade and commerce, which created new opportunities for economic and social mobility. The shift in the balance of power between the two parties was also influenced by the issue of slavery, which became a major point of contention in the 1820s and 1830s. The Republican Party, which was opposed to the expansion of slavery, gained support from northern states, while the Federalist Party, which was more sympathetic to the interests of the slave-holding South, declined. The rise of the Republican Party and the decline of the Federalist Party marked a significant shift in the balance of power in American politics, and had a lasting impact on the development of the American political system.","['https://www.archives.gov/files/legislative/resources/ebooks/two-party-system.pdf', 'https://dk.usembassy.gov/usa-i-skolen/presidential-elections-and-the-american-political-system/', 'http://education.ohio.gov/getattachment/Topics/Learning-in-Ohio/Social-Studies/Model-Curriculum-for-Social-Studies/SSMC_AmericanHistory.pdf.aspx?lang=en-US', 'https://www.fldoe.org/core/fileparse.php/20653/urlt/6-4.pdf', 'https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/jefferson/jefffed.html', 'https://www.britannica.com/place/United-States/The-United-States-from-1816-to-1850', 'https://tea.texas.gov/student-assessment/testing/staar/staar-released-test/staarg8-2017-test-socstudies-f.pdf', 'https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/federal-reserve-history', 'https://billofrightsinstitute.org/essays/the-hartford-convention', 'https://www.nysed.gov/sites/default/files/programs/curriculum-instruction/ss-framework-k-8a2.pdf', 'https://www.archives.gov/files/legislative/resources/ebooks/two-party-system.pdf', 'https://dk.usembassy.gov/usa-i-skolen/presidential-elections-and-the-american-political-system/', 'http://education.ohio.gov/getattachment/Topics/Learning-in-Ohio/Social-Studies/Model-Curriculum-for-Social-Studies/SSMC_AmericanHistory.pdf.aspx?lang=en-US', 'https://www.fldoe.org/core/fileparse.php/20653/urlt/6-4.pdf', 'https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/jefferson/jefffed.html', 'https://www.britannica.com/place/United-States/The-United-States-from-1816-to-1850', 'https://tea.texas.gov/student-assessment/testing/staar/staar-released-test/staarg8-2017-test-socstudies-f.pdf', 'https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/federal-reserve-history', 'https://billofrightsinstitute.org/essays/the-hartford-convention', 'https://www.nysed.gov/sites/default/files/programs/curriculum-instruction/ss-framework-k-8a2.pdf', 'https://www.archives.gov/files/legislative/resources/ebooks/two-party-system.pdf', 'https://dk.usembassy.gov/usa-i-skolen/presidential-elections-and-the-american-political-system/', 'http://education.ohio.gov/getattachment/Topics/Learning-in-Ohio/Social-Studies/Model-Curriculum-for-Social-Studies/SSMC_AmericanHistory.pdf.aspx?lang=en-US', 'https://www.fldoe.org/core/fileparse.php/20653/urlt/6-4.pdf', 'https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/jefferson/jefffed.html', 'https://www.britannica.com/place/United-States/The-United-States-from-1816-to-1850', 'https://tea.texas.gov/student-assessment/testing/staar/staar-released-test/staarg8-2017-test-socstudies-f.pdf', 'https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/federal-reserve-history', 'https://billofrightsinstitute.org/essays/the-hartford-convention', 'https://www.nysed.gov/sites/default/files/programs/curriculum-instruction/ss-framework-k-8a2.pdf']",politics
"The most immediate result was the end of the Cold War that had marred international relations was the sense of relief people felt all over the world. The Block Politics was over; the former USSR and its allies were no longer seen by the West as the ‘enemy’, but the countries of NATO and the Warsaw Pact signed a treaty agreeing that they were ‘no longer adversaries’.
2. Independence Explosion
The breakup of the USSR brought into existence more than two dozen independent nation-states previously known as the republics of the Soviet Union. By the summer of 1990, all of them had been replaced by democratically elected governments, setting the stage for the region’s reintegration into Western economic and political spheres.
4. The Emergence of a Unipolar World
The dissolution of the USSR left the U.S. as the only true world superpower, freeing its government from the constraints imposed by the existence of any threat from a powerful rival. However, it had an unintended consequence; it gave free hand to its erstwhile rival, the USA to implement its long-term dream of ushering in Pax Americana. This allowed the U.S. government to intervene militarily and otherwise in foreign countries without fear of major retaliation. The Gulf War would have never happened in the previous bipolar set-up as the USSR would have blocked it.
5. Accelerated Globalisation
The end of the Cold War led to greater interaction among the states and the people accelerating the globalisation process and completely altering the way nations communicate, negotiate, and interact with each other. Consequently, globalisation improved and expanded global commerce, brought more Foreign Direct Investment to developing countries, built infrastructure, and advanced literacy, inspired democratic movements via social networks, and created emerging middle classes all over the world.
6. Global Geopolitical Realignment
One of the inevitable results of the end of the Cold War was the geopolitical realignment of countries all over the world. The first casualty was the Non-aligned Movement (NAM) which lost its relevance as there were no more two blocks. The Soviet Union’s collapse also prompted the European Union to extend its influence into areas that Moscow once controlled. China replaced the Soviet Union to become a major world superpower taking a keen interest in global politics and creating its sphere of influence. Similarly, the reunification of Germany enhanced its position in the EU and NATO.
6. New conflicts, Crises, and Wars
Although the world returned to its default function of peace, there were isolated wars in different parts of the world. During the Cold War, the USSR and the USA had kept tight control, by force if necessary, over areas where their vital interests might be affected. Now, a conflict that did not directly affect the interests of East or West would probably be left to find its solution, bloody or otherwise. Most tragic of all was Yugoslavia, which broke up into five separate states. Soon a complex civil war broke out in which Bosnia, Serbs, Croats, and Muslims fought each other in an attempt to set up states of their own. This increasingly bitter struggle dragged on for almost four years until a ceasefire was arranged in November 1995.

11. Afghanistan War: 8 Causes of American Defeat","How did the collapse of the Soviet Union lead to an increase in international trade and commerce, and what factors contributed to this development?","The collapse of the Soviet Union led to an increase in international trade and commerce due to several factors. Firstly, the end of the Cold War and the subsequent reduction in tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union created a more stable and predictable global environment, which encouraged international trade and investment. Secondly, the Soviet Union's economic collapse led to a significant increase in the availability of goods and services, which created new opportunities for trade and commerce. Additionally, the Soviet Union's transition to a market-based economy led to the emergence of new businesses and industries, which contributed to the growth of international trade.

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) played a significant role in promoting international trade and commerce by providing a framework for cooperation and security among its member states. The organization's founding in 1949 was a response to the threat posed by the Soviet Union, but it also created a platform for member states to work together on economic and trade issues.

The Soviet Union's collapse also led to the emergence of new global powers, including the United States and the European Union. These powers played a significant role in promoting international trade and commerce by creating new trade agreements and institutions, such as the World Trade Organization (WTO). The WTO was established in 1995 to promote free and fair trade among its member states, and it has played a significant role in promoting international trade and commerce.

In addition to these factors, the Soviet Union's collapse also led to an increase in international trade and commerce due to the emergence of new technologies and innovations. The widespread adoption of the internet and other digital technologies has made it easier for businesses to trade and communicate with each other across borders, which has contributed to the growth of international trade and commerce.

Overall, the collapse of the Soviet Union led to an increase in international trade and commerce due to a combination of factors, including the end of the Cold War, the Soviet Union's economic collapse, the emergence of new global powers, and the widespread adoption of new technologies and innovations.","['https://online.norwich.edu/online/about/resource-library/consequences-collapse-soviet-union', 'https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/declassified_139339.htm', 'https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/01/how-globalization-4-0-fits-into-the-history-of-globalization/', 'https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2015/09/28/04/53/sp082500', 'https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/GlobalTrends_2040.pdf', 'https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2019/05/23/blog-the-impact-of-us-china-trade-tensions', 'https://www.commerce.gov/about/history/evolution', 'https://www.ers.usda.gov/amber-waves/2022/august/poultry-expected-to-continue-leading-global-meat-imports-as-demand-rises/', 'https://www.nationalww2museum.org/war/articles/new-global-power-after-world-war-ii-1945', 'https://www.mfa.gov.cn/eng/wjbxw/202206/t20220619_10706059.html']",politics

11. Afghanistan War: 8 Causes of American Defeat","** What were the long-term consequences of the end of the Cold War on the global system's ability to respond to humanitarian crises, and how did this impact the role of international organizations in crisis management?","The end of the Cold War had a profound impact on the global system's ability to respond to humanitarian crises, leading to a shift in the role of international organizations in crisis management. The end of the Cold War marked the beginning of a new geopolitical context for complex emergencies, and it led to a re-evaluation of the role of international organizations in crisis management.

The end of the Cold War led to a shift from a bipolar to a unipolar world, where the United States emerged as the sole superpower. This shift led to a re-evaluation of the role of international organizations, and many of them were reformed to reflect the new global landscape.

The United Nations, for example, was reformed to reflect the new global landscape, and it played a key role in responding to humanitarian crises in the 1990s. The UN's peacekeeping operations were expanded, and it played a key role in responding to conflicts in the Balkans, Africa, and Asia.

The European Union also played a key role in responding to humanitarian crises, and it launched a number of initiatives to promote peace and stability in the region. The EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy was established, and it played a key role in responding to crises in the Balkans and Africa.

The end of the Cold War also led to a shift in the way that international organizations responded to humanitarian crises. The UN and other international organizations began to focus more on preventive diplomacy and conflict prevention, and they launched a number of initiatives to promote peace and stability in conflict-prone regions.

The end of the Cold War also led to a shift in the way that international organizations responded to humanitarian crises. The UN and other international organizations began to focus more on humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, and they launched a number of initiatives to promote humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.

In conclusion, the end of the Cold War had a profound impact on the global system's ability to respond to humanitarian crises, leading to a shift in the role of international organizations in crisis management. The end of the Cold War marked the beginning of a new geopolitical context for complex emergencies, and it led to a re-evaluation of the role of international organizations in crisis management.","['https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/declassified_139339.htm', 'https://online.norwich.edu/online/about/resource-library/consequences-collapse-soviet-union', 'https://www.worldvision.org/refugees-news-stories/syrian-refugee-crisis-facts', 'https://press.un.org/en/2023/sc15184.doc.htm', 'https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fandd/issues/2020/06/how-will-the-world-be-different-after-COVID-19', 'https://www.state.gov/united-states-strategy-to-prevent-conflict-and-promote-stability/', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK223340/', 'https://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/berlin-airlift', 'https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjbxw/202404/t20240420_11285450.html', 'https://www.rescue.org/article/top-10-crises-world-cant-ignore-2023', 'https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_52060.htm', 'https://www.un.org/en/global-issues/peace-and-security', 'https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/declassified_139339.htm', 'https://press.un.org/en/2022/ga12407.doc.htm', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7140240/', 'https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjbxw/202302/t20230220_11027664.html', 'https://www.chathamhouse.org/2023/02/seven-ways-russias-war-ukraine-has-changed-world', 'https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2024/05/07/sp-geopolitics-impact-global-trade-and-dollar-gita-gopinath', 'https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/GlobalTrends_2040.pdf', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/09/21/remarks-by-president-biden-before-the-76th-session-of-the-united-nations-general-assembly/']",politics
"The most immediate result was the end of the Cold War that had marred international relations was the sense of relief people felt all over the world. The Block Politics was over; the former USSR and its allies were no longer seen by the West as the ‘enemy’, but the countries of NATO and the Warsaw Pact signed a treaty agreeing that they were ‘no longer adversaries’.
2. Independence Explosion
The breakup of the USSR brought into existence more than two dozen independent nation-states previously known as the republics of the Soviet Union. By the summer of 1990, all of them had been replaced by democratically elected governments, setting the stage for the region’s reintegration into Western economic and political spheres.
4. The Emergence of a Unipolar World
The dissolution of the USSR left the U.S. as the only true world superpower, freeing its government from the constraints imposed by the existence of any threat from a powerful rival. However, it had an unintended consequence; it gave free hand to its erstwhile rival, the USA to implement its long-term dream of ushering in Pax Americana. This allowed the U.S. government to intervene militarily and otherwise in foreign countries without fear of major retaliation. The Gulf War would have never happened in the previous bipolar set-up as the USSR would have blocked it.
5. Accelerated Globalisation
The end of the Cold War led to greater interaction among the states and the people accelerating the globalisation process and completely altering the way nations communicate, negotiate, and interact with each other. Consequently, globalisation improved and expanded global commerce, brought more Foreign Direct Investment to developing countries, built infrastructure, and advanced literacy, inspired democratic movements via social networks, and created emerging middle classes all over the world.
6. Global Geopolitical Realignment
One of the inevitable results of the end of the Cold War was the geopolitical realignment of countries all over the world. The first casualty was the Non-aligned Movement (NAM) which lost its relevance as there were no more two blocks. The Soviet Union’s collapse also prompted the European Union to extend its influence into areas that Moscow once controlled. China replaced the Soviet Union to become a major world superpower taking a keen interest in global politics and creating its sphere of influence. Similarly, the reunification of Germany enhanced its position in the EU and NATO.
6. New conflicts, Crises, and Wars
Although the world returned to its default function of peace, there were isolated wars in different parts of the world. During the Cold War, the USSR and the USA had kept tight control, by force if necessary, over areas where their vital interests might be affected. Now, a conflict that did not directly affect the interests of East or West would probably be left to find its solution, bloody or otherwise. Most tragic of all was Yugoslavia, which broke up into five separate states. Soon a complex civil war broke out in which Bosnia, Serbs, Croats, and Muslims fought each other in an attempt to set up states of their own. This increasingly bitter struggle dragged on for almost four years until a ceasefire was arranged in November 1995.

1. Develop a comprehensive cultural heritage preservation plan that identifies and prioritizes the most important cultural assets and traditions.
2. Establish a cultural heritage preservation agency or department to oversee the preservation and promotion of cultural heritage.
3. Implement measures to protect and conserve cultural heritage sites, such as restoration and renovation programs, and laws and regulations to prevent destruction or damage.
4. Promote cultural heritage through tourism, education, and community engagement, such as organizing cultural festivals and events, and providing training and capacity-building programs for local communities.
5. Encourage foreign investment in industries that are compatible with the local culture and heritage, such as sustainable tourism, cultural education, and traditional crafts.
6. Develop partnerships with international organizations, NGOs, and private sector companies to support cultural heritage preservation and promotion efforts.
7. Provide incentives and tax breaks to businesses that invest in cultural heritage preservation and promotion, such as tax credits for restoration and renovation projects.
8. Develop a system of cultural heritage certification and labeling to recognize and reward businesses and individuals that contribute to the preservation and promotion of cultural heritage.
9. Establish a cultural heritage fund to support preservation and promotion efforts, and to provide financial assistance to local communities and businesses that are involved in cultural heritage preservation and promotion.
10. Develop a comprehensive plan for the sustainable development of cultural heritage, that takes into account the social, economic, and environmental impacts of cultural heritage preservation and promotion.

A multi-faceted approach is necessary to address the competing interests and challenges.

Here are some effective strategies to promote sustainable development in regions with corruption and lack of transparency:

1. Strengthen governance and institutions: This can be achieved by promoting transparency, accountability, and good governance practices. This includes ensuring that government institutions are independent, effective, and accountable to the public.

2. Promote transparency and accountability: This can be achieved by implementing transparency and accountability mechanisms, such as freedom of information laws, whistleblower protection, and independent auditing and monitoring.

3. Encourage public participation and engagement: This can be achieved by promoting public participation and engagement in decision-making processes, ensuring that citizens have a voice in the development process, and that their concerns are heard and addressed.

4. Support sustainable infrastructure development: This can be achieved by promoting sustainable infrastructure development, such as renewable energy, green buildings, and sustainable transportation systems.

5. Foster a culture of integrity: This can be achieved by promoting a culture of integrity, where corruption is not tolerated and where individuals are held accountable for their actions.

6. Support education and training: This can be achieved by supporting education and training programs that promote good governance, transparency, and accountability.

7. Encourage private sector engagement: This can be achieved by encouraging private sector engagement in sustainable development initiatives, such as public-private partnerships and corporate social responsibility initiatives.

8. Support research and development: This can be achieved by supporting research and development initiatives that promote sustainable development, such as climate change mitigation and adaptation, and sustainable agriculture.

9. Encourage international cooperation: This can be achieved by encouraging international cooperation and collaboration on sustainable development initiatives, such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

10. Monitor and evaluate progress: This can be achieved by monitoring and evaluating progress towards sustainable development goals, and by identifying areas for improvement and taking corrective action.

By implementing these strategies, it is possible to promote sustainable development in regions with corruption and lack of transparency, and to create a more equitable and prosperous future for all.","['https://www.state.gov/united-states-strategy-to-prevent-conflict-and-promote-stability/', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7734391/', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/05/20/g7-hiroshima-leaders-communique/', 'https://press.un.org/en/2018/sc13493.doc.htm', 'https://ungass2021.unodc.org/uploads/ungass2021/documents/session1/contributions/UN_Common_Position_to_Address_Global_Corruption_Towards_UNGASS2021.pdf', 'https://www.u4.no/publications/health-sector-corruption.pdf', 'https://www.unodc.org/documents/Advocacy-Section/UNODC-Strategy-WEB.pdf', 'https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/governance-and-anti-corruption', 'https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/corruption/COSP/session8-resolutions.html', 'https://www.undp.org/eurasia/our-focus/governance', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7170369/', 'https://www.state.gov/united-states-strategy-to-prevent-conflict-and-promote-stability/', 'https://www.transparency.org/en/news/no-sustainable-development-without-tackling-corruption-sdg-16', 'https://www.usmcu.edu/Outreach/Marine-Corps-University-Press/Expeditions-with-MCUP-digital-journal/Water-Scarcity-in-Brazil/', 'https://www.transparency.org/en/news/cpi-2022-americas-corruption-criminal-networks-human-rights-abuses', 'https://www.csis.org/blogs/development-dispatch/public-procurement-transparency-and-its-potential-reduce-corruption-low', 'https://www.unodc.org/documents/corruption/Publications/2023/Rooting_Out_-_Introduction_to_addressing_corruption_fuelling_forest_loss_2023.pdf', 'https://www.csis.org/analysis/digitalizing-laos-improving-government-transparency-business-environment-and-human-capital', 'https://www.unodc.org/documents/Advocacy-Section/UNODC-Strategy-WEB.pdf', 'https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/04/08/belt-and-road-initiative-views-from-washington-moscow-and-beijing-pub-78774', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7170369/', 'https://www.state.gov/united-states-strategy-to-prevent-conflict-and-promote-stability/', 'https://www.transparency.org/en/news/no-sustainable-development-without-tackling-corruption-sdg-16', 'https://www.usmcu.edu/Outreach/Marine-Corps-University-Press/Expeditions-with-MCUP-digital-journal/Water-Scarcity-in-Brazil/', 'https://www.transparency.org/en/news/cpi-2022-americas-corruption-criminal-networks-human-rights-abuses', 'https://www.csis.org/blogs/development-dispatch/public-procurement-transparency-and-its-potential-reduce-corruption-low', 'https://www.unodc.org/documents/corruption/Publications/2023/Rooting_Out_-_Introduction_to_addressing_corruption_fuelling_forest_loss_2023.pdf', 'https://www.csis.org/analysis/digitalizing-laos-improving-government-transparency-business-environment-and-human-capital', 'https://www.unodc.org/documents/Advocacy-Section/UNODC-Strategy-WEB.pdf', 'https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/04/08/belt-and-road-initiative-views-from-washington-moscow-and-beijing-pub-78774']",politics

"The international politics is still directed by power politics in which states are the primary actors and other transnational or supranational bodies likes UN, WTO, corporate business are of much less value (Ghemawat 2011, 10-11) States prioritize their sovereignty and national geopolitical and economic interests. They routinely indulge in localization and protectionism to protect their economies. Therefore, it is erroneous to conclude that borders have disappeared and there is unequivocally free and unprecedented flow of goods, services, and capital.
The third viewpoint, as opposed to the above mentioned two perspectives, is that the world is at best ‘semi-global’. Therefore instead of taking globalization/integration and regulation/protectionism as mutually exclusive, it is necessary to understand that both regulation and integration overlap and complement each other. To evaluate how much the world is globalized let’s gauge some data that measures globalization mostly in terms of cross borders flows and activities. The cross-border mails and phone calls amount to only 1 and less than 2 percent respectively. Internet traffic that is well integrated across national borders amounts to 17 or 18 percent of all the internet traffic routed across borders. A cross-border spread of content also illustrates similar percentages.
Internationally acclaimed newsweekly such as Time only has 20 percent of readership outside America. Moreover, 21 percent of the news coverage in America is international. In Europe, international news coverage is about 38 percent. And most other states get 5 percent international news coverage. Technological information in the form of patents filed in rich OECD countries, (that accounts for 95 percent of the patents globally) foreign held patents are up to 15 percent.
As for the cross-border movement of people goes, only 3 percent of first-generation migration has occurred up till now. Also, students studying abroad amount to only 2 percent of all university students. Besides, the cross-border movements of people has also limited as much as 90 percent of the people are unlikely to leave their country of origin. At its all-time peak, the international trade was 29 percent in 2008 and then dropped to 23 percent in the subsequent year. Foreign direct investment also remains 10 percent on average. In other words, 90 percent of all fixed investment remains domestic. Only 15 to 20 percent of the capital is installed outside the investor’s home country. Almost 20 percent of the stock market is owned by foreign investors. Transnational proprietorship of bank deposits is approximately 25 percent and government debt remains up to 35 percent (Ghemawat 2011, 25-29)

"When Ukraine declared itself an independent state during the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, most Ukrainians celebrated the historic move. To Vladimir Putin, however, the formal separation of Ukraine from Russia represented the “greatest geopolitical catastrophe” of the 20th century.
Today, the two nations are locked in war. The inability to end the fighting in the foreseeable future will largely be driven by their shared history, about which Ukraine and Russia have starkly different views.
Another factor working against a swift end to the war is the inability of modern institutions to effectively prevent and handle crises like the Russia-Ukraine war, according to the political scientist and author Ian Bremmer. Still, amid this “geopolitical recession” lie opportunities to reinvigorate waning institutions and create new ones, hopefully rebalancing the global order for the better.
IAN BREMMER: For centuries, the Ukraine has been part of what Russians call 'the Motherland.'
NARRATOR: 'Crowds below cheering as the blue and yellow banner of independent Ukraine was hoisted.'
BREMMER: I was there for Ukraine's first day of independence, their or in Russian. There was an extraordinary outburst of emotion from Ukrainians and Russians, and Russian-Ukrainians, half and half, that were out on the street, and the flags being waved and the extraordinary feeling that they were giving birth to an independent nation that was rising from the ashes of a failed empire. And now of course, these two peoples are at war with each other, and that's where we are today. And I think that the inability to bring this war to a close anytime in the foreseeable future is going to be driven in large part by both the shared history and how closely connected they were; leading to the war crimes Ukraine is going through right now.
This is much deeper than just, 'Let's figure out how we can get both sides to get along.' I'm Ian Bremmer, President of Eurasia Group, and I just wrote the book, ""The Power of Crisis."" So I started my Ph.D. back in 1989. And there's no question that if you were thinking about the world as a political scientist, you were thinking about the Soviet Union. In the former Soviet Union, there were 15 Soviet Socialist Republics. And they all had political and cultural and social institutions. The Soviet Union was meant to be this crucible of all of these national differences.
I referred to this as 'Matryoshka nationalism,' the nesting dolls, where you have ethnic groups and territories that are aligned with them inside other ethnic groups and territories. So you've got the Soviet Union, and inside the Soviet Union, you have the 15 republics, then inside those republics, you have autonomous regions and autonomous areas. And so as a consequence, even though the Russians and the Ukrainians felt very fraternal and connected, there was a different Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic to the Russian Socialist Republic. And interestingly, when Stalin was the Commissar of Nationalities, he was very involved in not only creating a lot of these territories, but also moving people around. This brought Russians into these territories to ensure that if the Soviet Union ever fell apart, that there were these tripwires that would actually create massive confrontation that would help to ensure that the Soviet Union couldn't actually implode.
NARRATOR: 'Mr. Gorbachev wants to bring the Communist party up to date. Its old fashioned methods are blocking his reforms at home and abroad.'
BREMMER: When Gorbachev became General Secretary, he fundamentally unwound the power that connected these people in what Putin refers to as 'The Greatest Geopolitical Catastrophe of the 20th Century.' There were three different manifestations: First, 'Perestroika,' he said, ""I'm going to economically reform so the money that you make isn't coming from the government. You can have your own independent enterprises. Secondly, we're going to have 'Glasnost.' You're gonna be able to write and say what you want. And then we're gonna do something called 'Khozraschyot,' which is self-accounting."" And that is decentralization of power. And what does that mean? It means in very short order, the Soviet Union implodes, but it implodes precisely because of ethnic and national animus. It's primarily 15 different nations that want independence for their countries, which already have the political and the institutional framework ready-made. All you needed to do was get rid of the top doll in the Matryoshka, and the other Matryoshkas all pop up.
NARRATOR: 'Regimes in communist countries have been quietly or not quietly, like in Romania, washed out by the people- we used so many times to say that power is in the hands of the people. When it finally happened, everybody is surprised.'
NARRATOR: 'The roadblock now sports Russian flags. President Putin has said there should be no more violence, but it feels as if Crimea is being annexed day by day.'","What would be the cultural implications of a sudden shift to a unified language policy in Ukraine, considering the country's linguistic diversity and historical context of Soviet-era language policies?","The cultural implications of a sudden shift to a unified language policy in Ukraine would be multifaceted and far-reaching, considering the country's linguistic diversity and historical context of Soviet-era language policies.

The sudden shift would likely lead to a sense of cultural loss and identity crisis among the Ukrainian-speaking population, particularly in the eastern and southern regions where Russian is widely spoken. This could result in a backlash against the government and a sense of disconnection from the Ukrainian cultural heritage.

On the other hand, a unified language policy could also lead to a sense of national unity and a shared cultural identity among Ukrainians. It could also promote economic development and integration with the European Union, as a unified language policy would facilitate communication and trade.

Moreover, a unified language policy could also have implications for the country's cultural institutions and the preservation of its cultural heritage. It could lead to a greater emphasis on Ukrainian language and culture, and a reduction in the influence of Russian language and culture.

In conclusion, the cultural implications of a sudden shift to a unified language policy in Ukraine would be complex and multifaceted, and would depend on a variety of factors, including the specific policies implemented, the level of public support, and the historical and cultural context of the country.","['http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/66181', 'https://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/kennan-cable-no15-ukraine-whats-language-for', 'https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2018/10/29/eastern-and-western-europeans-differ-on-importance-of-religion-views-of-minorities-and-key-social-issues/', 'https://rm.coe.int/common-european-framework-of-reference-for-languages-learning-teaching/16809ea0d4', 'https://neighbourhood-enlargement.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2023-11/SWD_2023_699%20Ukraine%20report.pdf', 'https://europeanmovement.eu/policy/policy-position-on-culture-and-cultural-heritage/', 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10286632.2023.2187053', 'https://www.husj.harvard.edu/articles/language-status-and-state-loyalty-in-ukraine', 'https://scholarcommons.sc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1689&context=senior_theses', 'https://www.rochester.edu/newscenter/ukraine-history-fact-checking-putin-513812/', 'http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/66181', 'https://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/kennan-cable-no15-ukraine-whats-language-for', 'https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2018/10/29/eastern-and-western-europeans-differ-on-importance-of-religion-views-of-minorities-and-key-social-issues/', 'https://rm.coe.int/common-european-framework-of-reference-for-languages-learning-teaching/16809ea0d4', 'https://neighbourhood-enlargement.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2023-11/SWD_2023_699%20Ukraine%20report.pdf', 'https://europeanmovement.eu/policy/policy-position-on-culture-and-cultural-heritage/', 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10286632.2023.2187053', 'https://www.husj.harvard.edu/articles/language-status-and-state-loyalty-in-ukraine', 'https://scholarcommons.sc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1689&context=senior_theses', 'https://www.rochester.edu/newscenter/ukraine-history-fact-checking-putin-513812/']",politics

"When Ukraine declared itself an independent state during the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, most Ukrainians celebrated the historic move. To Vladimir Putin, however, the formal separation of Ukraine from Russia represented the “greatest geopolitical catastrophe” of the 20th century.
Today, the two nations are locked in war. The inability to end the fighting in the foreseeable future will largely be driven by their shared history, about which Ukraine and Russia have starkly different views.
Another factor working against a swift end to the war is the inability of modern institutions to effectively prevent and handle crises like the Russia-Ukraine war, according to the political scientist and author Ian Bremmer. Still, amid this “geopolitical recession” lie opportunities to reinvigorate waning institutions and create new ones, hopefully rebalancing the global order for the better.
IAN BREMMER: For centuries, the Ukraine has been part of what Russians call 'the Motherland.'
NARRATOR: 'Crowds below cheering as the blue and yellow banner of independent Ukraine was hoisted.'
BREMMER: I was there for Ukraine's first day of independence, their or in Russian. There was an extraordinary outburst of emotion from Ukrainians and Russians, and Russian-Ukrainians, half and half, that were out on the street, and the flags being waved and the extraordinary feeling that they were giving birth to an independent nation that was rising from the ashes of a failed empire. And now of course, these two peoples are at war with each other, and that's where we are today. And I think that the inability to bring this war to a close anytime in the foreseeable future is going to be driven in large part by both the shared history and how closely connected they were; leading to the war crimes Ukraine is going through right now.
This is much deeper than just, 'Let's figure out how we can get both sides to get along.' I'm Ian Bremmer, President of Eurasia Group, and I just wrote the book, ""The Power of Crisis."" So I started my Ph.D. back in 1989. And there's no question that if you were thinking about the world as a political scientist, you were thinking about the Soviet Union. In the former Soviet Union, there were 15 Soviet Socialist Republics. And they all had political and cultural and social institutions. The Soviet Union was meant to be this crucible of all of these national differences.
I referred to this as 'Matryoshka nationalism,' the nesting dolls, where you have ethnic groups and territories that are aligned with them inside other ethnic groups and territories. So you've got the Soviet Union, and inside the Soviet Union, you have the 15 republics, then inside those republics, you have autonomous regions and autonomous areas. And so as a consequence, even though the Russians and the Ukrainians felt very fraternal and connected, there was a different Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic to the Russian Socialist Republic. And interestingly, when Stalin was the Commissar of Nationalities, he was very involved in not only creating a lot of these territories, but also moving people around. This brought Russians into these territories to ensure that if the Soviet Union ever fell apart, that there were these tripwires that would actually create massive confrontation that would help to ensure that the Soviet Union couldn't actually implode.
NARRATOR: 'Mr. Gorbachev wants to bring the Communist party up to date. Its old fashioned methods are blocking his reforms at home and abroad.'
BREMMER: When Gorbachev became General Secretary, he fundamentally unwound the power that connected these people in what Putin refers to as 'The Greatest Geopolitical Catastrophe of the 20th Century.' There were three different manifestations: First, 'Perestroika,' he said, ""I'm going to economically reform so the money that you make isn't coming from the government. You can have your own independent enterprises. Secondly, we're going to have 'Glasnost.' You're gonna be able to write and say what you want. And then we're gonna do something called 'Khozraschyot,' which is self-accounting."" And that is decentralization of power. And what does that mean? It means in very short order, the Soviet Union implodes, but it implodes precisely because of ethnic and national animus. It's primarily 15 different nations that want independence for their countries, which already have the political and the institutional framework ready-made. All you needed to do was get rid of the top doll in the Matryoshka, and the other Matryoshkas all pop up.

The Russian economy is heavily dependent on oil and natural gas, which makes up 45% of its federal budget. A decrease in oil prices would lead to a reduction in government revenues, making it challenging for Russia to sustain its military involvement in the conflict.

On the other hand, an increase in oil prices would lead to an increase in government revenues, allowing Russia to continue its military involvement. However, this would also lead to higher costs for consumers and potentially destabilize the global economy.

The Russian military's ability to sustain its involvement in the conflict would also be impacted by the impact of sanctions on its energy sector. Sanctions have already had a significant impact on Russia's economy, and a further increase in oil prices could exacerbate this situation.

In conclusion, a shift in global oil prices would have significant implications for Russia's ability to sustain its involvement in the conflict, and the Russian military's ability to sustain its involvement would be heavily dependent on the impact of oil prices on the Russian economy.","['https://www.iea.org/articles/energy-fact-sheet-why-does-russian-oil-and-gas-matter', 'https://home.treasury.gov/news/featured-stories/sanctions-and-russias-war-limiting-putins-capabilities', 'https://www.iea.org/countries/russia', 'https://home.treasury.gov/news/featured-stories/the-price-cap-on-russian-oil-a-progress-report', 'https://www.economicsobservatory.com/what-is-the-current-state-of-the-russian-economy-under-sanctions', 'https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/content-series/russia-tomorrow/oil-gas-and-war/', 'https://warsawinstitute.org/russias-economy-becoming-heavily-dependent-hydrocarbons/', 'https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/03/08/russias-reliance-on-energy-spells-trouble-for-its-economy', 'https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/russian-economy-war-footing-new-reality-financed-commodity-exports', 'https://www.bbc.com/news/58888451', 'https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2022/03/15/blog-how-war-in-ukraine-is-reverberating-across-worlds-regions-031522', 'https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/03/how-does-the-war-in-ukraine-affect-oil-prices/', 'https://www.csis.org/analysis/climate-change-will-reshape-russia', 'https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/infographics/impact-sanctions-russian-economy/', 'https://home.treasury.gov/news/featured-stories/sanctions-and-russias-war-limiting-putins-capabilities', 'https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/030315/how-does-price-oil-affect-russias-economy.asp', 'https://home.treasury.gov/news/featured-stories/the-price-cap-on-russian-oil-a-progress-report', 'https://www.iea.org/topics/russias-war-on-ukraine', 'https://www.economicsobservatory.com/ukraine-whats-the-global-economic-impact-of-russias-invasion', 'https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/russia/publication/rer', 'https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/ATA-2023-Unclassified-Report.pdf', 'https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/eu-response-ukraine-invasion/', 'https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/ATA-2024-Unclassified-Report.pdf', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Biden-Harris-Administrations-National-Security-Strategy-10.2022.pdf', 'https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/documents-publications/library/library-blog/posts/think-tank-reports-on-russia-s-war-of-aggression-against-ukraine/', 'https://www.chathamhouse.org/2023/02/seven-ways-russias-war-ukraine-has-changed-world', 'https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2404', 'https://www.international.gc.ca/world-monde/issues_development-enjeux_developpement/response_conflict-reponse_conflits/crisis-crises/ukraine-fact-fait.aspx?lang=eng', 'https://home.treasury.gov/news/featured-stories/sanctions-and-russias-war-limiting-putins-capabilities', 'https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_49208.htm']",politics

On one hand, it could lead to a more efficient and streamlined decision-making process, as the central government would have direct control over key sectors of the economy. This could potentially lead to increased economic growth and development. However, it could also lead to a concentration of power, erosion of regional autonomy, and a lack of representation for local interests.

On the other hand, the consequences of centralization of power could be devastating. It could lead to a lack of accountability, corruption, and abuse of power. The central government may use its authority to suppress dissent and opposition, leading to a decline in human rights and freedoms. Additionally, the centralization of power may lead to a lack of innovation and creativity, as local initiatives and ideas may be stifled by the centralized authority.

Furthermore, the centralization of power could also have negative consequences for the economy. It could lead to a lack of competition, as local businesses and industries may be unable to compete with the centralized authority. This could result in a decline in economic growth and development, as well as a lack of job opportunities.

In conclusion, the implications of a centralized institution bypassing regional governments are complex and multifaceted. While it may lead to increased efficiency and economic growth, it could also lead to a concentration of power, erosion of regional autonomy, and a lack of representation for local interests. Therefore, it is essential to carefully consider the potential consequences of such a move and to ensure that it is implemented in a way that balances the needs of the central government with the needs of local communities.","['https://www.epa.gov/energy/centralized-generation-electricity-and-its-impacts-environment', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7734391/', 'https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/imf-and-covid19/Policy-Responses-to-COVID-19', 'https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/GlobalTrends_2040.pdf', 'https://www.epi.org/publication/the-economic-costs-and-benefits-of-airbnb-no-reason-for-local-policymakers-to-let-airbnb-bypass-tax-or-regulatory-obligations/', 'https://academic.oup.com/cjres/article/11/3/541/5123936', 'https://www.jri.co.jp/english/periodical/rim/1999/RIMe199904threereforms/', 'https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/what-we-do/nih-almanac/national-cancer-institute-nci', 'https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/07/hong-kong-national-security-law-10-things-you-need-to-know/', 'https://www.usip.org/publications/2022/09/how-climate-change-catalyzes-more-migration-central-america', 'https://muse.jhu.edu/article/878554', 'https://www.epa.gov/energy/centralized-generation-electricity-and-its-impacts-environment', 'https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00355-020-01284-w', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147596720300147', 'https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/2022-11/Chapter_1--CCP_Decision-Making_and_Xi_Jinpings_Centralization_of_Authority.pdf', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8913406/', 'https://www.mof.go.jp/english/pri/publication/pp_review/ppr16_03_02.pdf', 'https://www.imf.org/en/About/Factsheets/Sheets/2023/monetary-policy-and-central-banking', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9681988/', 'https://www.nber.org/papers/w22250']",politics
"There should be no surprise, then, when the issue of the sign is problematized politically, in the relation between two individuals that assert different marks to each other. When discourse becomes speech, politics is born. Since men have equal faculties and potentialities (Hobbes, 2005HOBBES, Thomas. (2005), “Leviathan or the matter, form and power of a common wealth ecclesiastical and civil”, in Michael Morgan (ed.), Classics of moral and political theory, 4. ed., Cambridge, Hackett Publishing Company., p. 591), they strive to impose their respective private assertions as the dominant ones. This competition to awe the others and to obliterate the different conceptions of “marks”, and attempts to signify the external world shapes the commonwealth.
If we follow Hobbes, the problem of communication arises as a question of morality. When expressing sense, one is communicating a form of value. If one says, “the field is green” or “killing is wrong”, the adjective value that is expressed is one the speaker will be willing to sustain especially if the other speaker is saying, “the field is blue” or “killing is sometimes acceptable.” For Hobbes, as long as the individuals are in a position of equality and no dimension of sense is made public, war will prevail. This is because men need a determined form of indexation to be the form of signification, which is common to all men. Hobbes does not entirely dispute the classical notion of language as convention, such as the one that we find in Aristotle. However, if in Aristotle the use of reason could lead to an irresistible grammatical structure of norms and speech, for Hobbes no convention of this sort is possible without a dominant power that imposes a way of speaking and a standard of indexation.

This means that what the forthcoming social contract regulates is not simply the form of an expression; it is the content of an indexation, which is limited by the contract.

In this sense, singular opinions must find some support on the contract; otherwise, individuals will not be prone to transfer their singularity to the State. Consequently, the State seeks to reduce difference in opinion and action through the contract, and in the Leviathan the rights of the individual person are connected to the renounce of individual wills to the will-of-the-State. The discursive practices are then limited politically in order to tame the inclination to conflict of individuals in the anarchic position – and power is limited to the scope of the contract. Thus, the sphere of thought, of private life and internal practices are not regulated – and could not be regulated – by contract. It is interesting to note that the emergence of rights of privacy and to private life is only possible when the individual is situated under the rule of the sovereign. Before the emergence of the written law and the contract, individuals do not have any rights of personality. They are neither people nor subjects, but merely living bodies that are not situated in proper political relation, but in anarchic conflict.
Egotistic individuals will only recognize each other, in Hobbes, as this other is inserted in a space of similitude: into a political space and as a political body – as persons. This movement is both discursive and exclusionary. It also grounds a new form of understanding politics: as an artificial construction of a space for discourse and action. This separation of the individual in the State as a relevant and protected being and the individual outside the state as an abandoned and anarchic singularity that neither respects nor needs protection would shape modernity – and define liberalism as a theoretical school of thought.

Towards social action","What is the primary mechanism by which a modern government, informed by Hobbesian principles, ensures the protection of individual rights and freedoms in the face of emerging environmental threats, such as climate change?","The primary mechanism by which a modern government, informed by Hobbesian principles, ensures the protection of individual rights and freedoms in the face of emerging environmental threats, such as climate change, is through the establishment of a social contract that prioritizes the protection of individual rights and freedoms. This social contract is based on the idea that individuals voluntarily give up some of their power to the government in exchange for protection and security. The government, in turn, is responsible for ensuring the protection of individual rights and freedoms, including the right to life, liberty, and property.

In the context of environmental protection, this means that the government has a responsibility to protect the environment and ensure the well-being of its citizens. This can be achieved through the implementation of policies and regulations that promote sustainable development, reduce pollution, and protect natural resources.

Additionally, Hobbesian principles also emphasize the importance of international cooperation and the need for states to work together to address global environmental challenges. This can be achieved through the establishment of international agreements and treaties that promote cooperation and coordination on environmental issues.

Overall, the primary mechanism by which a modern government, informed by Hobbesian principles, ensures the protection of individual rights and freedoms in the face of emerging environmental threats is through the establishment of a social contract that prioritizes the protection of individual rights and freedoms, and the implementation of policies and regulations that promote sustainable development and environmental protection.","['https://iep.utm.edu/hobmoral/', 'https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/realism-intl-relations/', 'https://iep.utm.edu/hobmeth/', 'https://www.britannica.com/topic/state-of-nature-political-theory', 'https://www.battlefields.org/learn/articles/hobbes-locke-and-social-contract', 'https://brill.com/display/book/9789004372887/BP000019.xml?language=en', 'https://www.yalelawjournal.org/essay/the-domestic-analogy-revisited-hobbes-on-international-order', 'https://f1000research.com/articles/11-1109', 'https://oehha.ca.gov/media/downloads/risk-assessment/report/healthefftsassess041621.pdf', 'https://www.utc.edu/health-education-and-professional-studies/center-for-reflective-citizenship/2017-faculty-fellow-american-history-and-government-teaching-modules/thomas-hobbes-john-locke', 'https://iep.utm.edu/hobmoral/', 'https://oehha.ca.gov/media/downloads/risk-assessment/report/fooddyesassessmentdraft082820.pdf', 'https://iep.utm.edu/soc-cont/', 'https://carnegieendowment.org/2022/11/28/to-prevent-collapse-of-biodiversity-world-needs-new-planetary-politics-pub-88473', 'https://www.unodc.org/e4j/en/crime-prevention-criminal-justice/module-5/key-issues/1--policing-in-democracies-and-the-need-for-accountability--integrity--oversight.html', 'https://www.yalelawjournal.org/essay/the-domestic-analogy-revisited-hobbes-on-international-order', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7719575/', 'https://medium.com/@calebwsl_/the-politics-of-calvin-and-hobbes-b032239025cc', 'https://www.jstor.org/stable/222667', 'https://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1714&context=facpubs', 'https://iep.utm.edu/hobmoral/', 'https://medium.com/@calebwsl_/the-politics-of-calvin-and-hobbes-b032239025cc', 'https://iep.utm.edu/soc-cont/', 'https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/locke-political/', 'https://www.yalelawjournal.org/essay/the-domestic-analogy-revisited-hobbes-on-international-order', 'https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/02/government-responsibility-to-citizens-anne-marie-slaughter/', 'https://carnegieendowment.org/2022/11/28/to-prevent-collapse-of-biodiversity-world-needs-new-planetary-politics-pub-88473', 'https://www.heritage.org/conservatism/commentary/republic-if-you-want-it', 'http://highline.huffingtonpost.com/articles/en/poor-millennials', 'https://www.hoover.org/research/leviathan-then-and-now']",politics
"There should be no surprise, then, when the issue of the sign is problematized politically, in the relation between two individuals that assert different marks to each other.

Towards social action","In a society where a small group of individuals hold significant economic power, what would be the most effective way to ensure that their interests do not dominate the social contract, potentially leading to inequalities and injustices?","To ensure that the interests of the economically powerful do not dominate the social contract, it is essential to implement a multifaceted approach that addresses the root causes of inequality and promotes checks and balances. This can be achieved through a combination of policies and mechanisms that reduce economic inequality, promote social mobility, and protect the rights of marginalized groups. Some potential mechanisms to prevent economic inequality include:

1. Increasing the minimum wage and expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit to help low-income families.
2. Building assets for working families, such as savings accounts and retirement plans, to help them build wealth.
3. Investing in education and job training programs to help individuals acquire skills and improve their employability.
4. Implementing policies to reduce poverty and disrupt the link between low income and poor health, such as taxation and income transfers to the poorest segment of society.
5. Promoting economic growth and development through investments in infrastructure, education, and research and development.
6. Implementing policies to reduce racial and ethnic inequality, such as affirmative action and anti-discrimination laws.
7. Strengthening labor unions and collective bargaining rights to help workers negotiate better wages and benefits.
8. Implementing policies to reduce income inequality on depression, such as providing mental health services and reducing stress.
9. Reducing both within- and between-country inequality by promoting equitable resource distribution, investing in education and skills development, and implementing policies to reduce poverty and inequality.
10. Implementing policies to reduce the wealth gap between the rich and the poor, such as progressive taxation and wealth redistribution.

It is also important to recognize that economic inequality is a complex issue that requires a comprehensive and multifaceted approach. It is not sufficient to rely on a single policy or mechanism to address the problem, but rather a combination of policies and mechanisms that work together to reduce economic inequality and promote social mobility.","['https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2015/sdn1513.pdf', 'https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-97863-7', 'https://repository.law.umich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2723&context=articles', 'https://carnegieendowment.org/2021/03/18/south-africa-when-strong-institutions-and-massive-inequalities-collide-pub-84063', 'https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/conviction-imprisonment-and-lost-earnings-how-involvement-criminal', 'https://www.americanprogress.org/article/systematic-inequality/', 'https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/misdemeanor-system-reinforces-economic-inequality', 'https://harvardlawreview.org/print/vol-131/reconstructing-the-administrative-state-in-an-era-of-economic-and-democratic-crisis/', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S001429210600122X', 'https://www.mfa.gov.cn/eng/wjbxw/202206/t20220619_10706059.html', 'https://belonging.berkeley.edu/six-policies-reduce-economic-inequality', 'https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2015/sdn1513.pdf', 'https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hpb20180817.901935/', 'https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fandd/issues/2018/03/bourguignon', 'https://endhomelessness.org/homelessness-in-america/what-causes-homelessness/inequality/', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5775138/', 'https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/inequality/', 'https://talkpoverty.org/2015/06/10/solutions-economic-inequality/index.html', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3169799/', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214629623004097', 'https://belonging.berkeley.edu/six-policies-reduce-economic-inequality', 'https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2015/sdn1513.pdf', 'https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hpb20180817.901935/', 'https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fandd/issues/2018/03/bourguignon', 'https://endhomelessness.org/homelessness-in-america/what-causes-homelessness/inequality/', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5775138/', 'https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/inequality/', 'https://talkpoverty.org/2015/06/10/solutions-economic-inequality/index.html', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3169799/', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214629623004097', 'https://belonging.berkeley.edu/six-policies-reduce-economic-inequality', 'https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2015/sdn1513.pdf', 'https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hpb20180817.901935/', 'https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fandd/issues/2018/03/bourguignon', 'https://endhomelessness.org/homelessness-in-america/what-causes-homelessness/inequality/', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5775138/', 'https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/inequality/', 'https://talkpoverty.org/2015/06/10/solutions-economic-inequality/index.html', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3169799/', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214629623004097']",politics

Towards social action","Can you explain how the concept of representation in Hobbes' theory relates to the idea of a ""tragic flaw"" in a character, and how this connection might shed light on the role of representation in facilitating compromise in modern political systems?","The connection between Hobbes' concept of representation and the idea of a ""tragic flaw"" in a character can shed light on the role of representation in facilitating compromise in modern political systems. In Hobbes' theory, representation is the process by which individuals delegate their authority to a representative, who then acts on their behalf. This concept can be applied to the idea of a ""tragic flaw"" in a character, where a character's flaw or weakness can lead to their downfall.

In modern political systems, representation is crucial for facilitating compromise. When individuals are represented by a representative, they can delegate their authority and trust that their representative will act in their best interests. This can lead to a more efficient and effective decision-making process, as representatives can negotiate and compromise on behalf of their constituents.

However, the concept of a ""tragic flaw"" can also be applied to the role of representation in facilitating compromise. Just as a character's flaw can lead to their downfall, a representative's flaw or weakness can lead to a breakdown in the compromise process. For example, a representative may be overly influenced by special interest groups or may have a personal agenda that conflicts with the best interests of their constituents.

In conclusion, the connection between Hobbes' concept of representation and the idea of a ""tragic flaw"" in a character can shed light on the role of representation in facilitating compromise in modern political systems. By understanding the importance of representation and the potential flaws or weaknesses of representatives, we can work towards creating a more effective and efficient decision-making process.","['https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/political-representation/hobbess-theory-of-representation-antidemocratic-or-protodemocratic/D67C54E672180367A64187E69881ED69', 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.0966-8373.2005.00226.x', 'https://www.jstor.org/stable/3685330', 'https://brill.com/display/title/13830?language=en', 'https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/706987', 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01916599.2021.1975150', 'https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1474885117731941', 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01916599.2020.1779466', 'https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Concept_of_Representation.html?id=AgUVWLswTNEC', 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01916599.2021.1975150', 'https://study.com/academy/lesson/tragic-flaw-definition-examples.html', 'https://blog.daisie.com/tragic-flaw-definition-examples-significance/', 'https://www.supersummary.com/tragic-flaw/', 'https://www.cliffsnotes.com/cliffsnotes/subjects/literature/what-is-a-tragic-flaw', 'https://www.thoughtco.com/tragic-flaw-definition-examples-4177154', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_flaw', 'https://www.britannica.com/art/hamartia', 'https://www.ultius.com/glossary/literature/literature-vocabulary/fatal-flaw.html', 'https://literarydevices.net/tragic-flaw/', 'https://becomeawritertoday.com/examples-of-tragic-flaw/', 'https://www.senate.gov/about/origins-foundations/senate-and-constitution/equal-state-representation.htm', 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28318429/', 'https://protectdemocracy.org/work/can-proportional-representation-create-better-governance/', 'https://www.jud.ct.gov/lawlib/history/sherman.htm', 'https://patentcenter.uspto.gov/applications/11824561', 'https://organizingengagement.org/principles/facilitation/', 'https://patentcenter.uspto.gov/applications/17009438', 'https://www.fhfa.gov/policy/representation-and-warranty-framework', 'https://patentcenter.uspto.gov/applications/18109033', 'https://www.marqo.ai/blog/matryoshka-representation-learning-with-clip-for-multimodal-retrieval-and-ranking']",politics

Towards social action","Can a democratic government effectively balance the needs of individual citizens with the needs of the collective good, and what implications would this have for the concept of individual liberty in a liberal democracy?","The concept of individual liberty in a liberal democracy is often seen as being in tension with the collective good, as individual rights and freedoms may conflict with the needs of the community. However, many scholars and politicians argue that a democratic government can effectively balance these competing interests by promoting a sense of shared responsibility and collective action.

For example, some argue that a strong social safety net and public goods can help to promote individual well-being and freedom, while also benefiting the community as a whole. Others argue that democratic institutions and processes, such as free and fair elections and the rule of law, are essential for protecting individual rights and freedoms.

Ultimately, the key to balancing individual liberty and the collective good in a democratic government is to create a system that is responsive to the needs and preferences of all citizens, while also promoting a sense of shared responsibility and collective action. This can be achieved through a combination of policies and institutions that promote social justice, economic equality, and individual freedom.

In conclusion, the relationship between individual liberty and the collective good in a democratic government is complex and multifaceted. While there are many challenges and tensions involved, a democratic government can effectively balance these competing interests by promoting a sense of shared responsibility and collective action.","['https://www.scu.edu/mcae/publications/iie/v5n1/common.html', 'https://www.amazon.com/American-Character-History-Struggle-Individual/dp/0525427899', 'https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-018-0151-3', 'https://www.nationalww2museum.org/war/articles/ndividual-liberties-wwii-present-crisis', 'https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2021/12/07/global-public-opinion-in-an-era-of-democratic-anxiety/', 'https://www.state.gov/bureaus-offices/under-secretary-for-civilian-security-democracy-and-human-rights/bureau-of-democracy-human-rights-and-labor/', 'https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/official_texts_17120.htm', 'https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/campaign-address-progressive-government-the-commonwealth-club-san-francisco-california', 'https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_68144.htm', 'https://www.c-span.org/classroom/document/?7259', 'https://www.scu.edu/mcae/publications/iie/v5n1/common.html', 'https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-018-0151-3', 'https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2021/12/07/global-public-opinion-in-an-era-of-democratic-anxiety/', 'https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/official_texts_217320.htm', 'https://www.supremecourt.gov/publicinfo/speeches/sp_11-17-04.html', 'https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/nsc/nssall.html', 'https://education.ohio.gov/getattachment/Topics/Learning-in-Ohio/Social-Studies/Ohio-s-Learning-Standards-for-Social-Studies/SSFinalStandards01019.pdf.aspx?lang=en-US', 'https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/campaign-address-progressive-government-the-commonwealth-club-san-francisco-california', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2267241/', 'https://www.usaid.gov/democracy', 'https://www.scu.edu/mcae/publications/iie/v5n1/common.html', 'https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-018-0151-3', 'https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2021/12/07/global-public-opinion-in-an-era-of-democratic-anxiety/', 'https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/official_texts_217320.htm', 'https://www.supremecourt.gov/publicinfo/speeches/sp_11-17-04.html', 'https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/nsc/nssall.html', 'https://education.ohio.gov/getattachment/Topics/Learning-in-Ohio/Social-Studies/Ohio-s-Learning-Standards-for-Social-Studies/SSFinalStandards01019.pdf.aspx?lang=en-US', 'https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/campaign-address-progressive-government-the-commonwealth-club-san-francisco-california', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2267241/', 'https://www.usaid.gov/democracy']",politics
"There should be no surprise, then, when the issue of the sign is problematized politically, in the relation between two individuals that assert different marks to each other. When discourse becomes speech, politics is born. Since men have equal faculties and potentialities (Hobbes, 2005HOBBES, Thomas. (2005), “Leviathan or the matter, form and power of a common wealth ecclesiastical and civil”, in Michael Morgan (ed.), Classics of moral and political theory, 4. ed., Cambridge, Hackett Publishing Company., p. 591), they strive to impose their respective private assertions as the dominant ones. This competition to awe the others and to obliterate the different conceptions of “marks”, and attempts to signify the external world shapes the commonwealth.
If we follow Hobbes, the problem of communication arises as a question of morality. When expressing sense, one is communicating a form of value. If one says, “the field is green” or “killing is wrong”, the adjective value that is expressed is one the speaker will be willing to sustain especially if the other speaker is saying, “the field is blue” or “killing is sometimes acceptable.” For Hobbes, as long as the individuals are in a position of equality and no dimension of sense is made public, war will prevail. This is because men need a determined form of indexation to be the form of signification, which is common to all men. Hobbes does not entirely dispute the classical notion of language as convention, such as the one that we find in Aristotle. However, if in Aristotle the use of reason could lead to an irresistible grammatical structure of norms and speech, for Hobbes no convention of this sort is possible without a dominant power that imposes a way of speaking and a standard of indexation. Such sovereign imposition is, nota bene, one of content, not of form. This means that what the forthcoming social contract regulates is not simply the form of an expression; it is the content of an indexation, which is limited by the contract. In this, Hobbes is still a son of feudal organization (Gay, 1966GAY, Peter. (1966), Enlighten, the rise of modern paganism. New York, Vintage., p. 17). A higher form of order, preferably Divine, is preferable for social organization, rather than hoping for a consensual ordering of desires by individuals. The paradigmatic shift in Hobbes is clear, though, when we realize that singular opinions may still be relevant privately, and are not dependent on divine inspiration. Still, the dominant form has a determined content and scope – and that is the scope any publicly held expression must follow.
But for all his demands for a strong hand dealing the cards of what is and what is not feasible in the social order, Hobbes requires some sort of representation in the contract. In this sense, singular opinions must find some support on the contract; otherwise, individuals will not be prone to transfer their singularity to the State. Consequently, the State seeks to reduce difference in opinion and action through the contract, and in the Leviathan the rights of the individual person are connected to the renounce of individual wills to the will-of-the-State. The discursive practices are then limited politically in order to tame the inclination to conflict of individuals in the anarchic position – and power is limited to the scope of the contract. Thus, the sphere of thought, of private life and internal practices are not regulated – and could not be regulated – by contract. It is interesting to note that the emergence of rights of privacy and to private life is only possible when the individual is situated under the rule of the sovereign. Before the emergence of the written law and the contract, individuals do not have any rights of personality. They are neither people nor subjects, but merely living bodies that are not situated in proper political relation, but in anarchic conflict.
Egotistic individuals will only recognize each other, in Hobbes, as this other is inserted in a space of similitude: into a political space and as a political body – as persons. This movement is both discursive and exclusionary. It also grounds a new form of understanding politics: as an artificial construction of a space for discourse and action. This separation of the individual in the State as a relevant and protected being and the individual outside the state as an abandoned and anarchic singularity that neither respects nor needs protection would shape modernity – and define liberalism as a theoretical school of thought. It also paves the way for the understanding of the Empire of Rights as characteristic of the modern age.
Towards social action","How does the concept of equality in Hobbes' social contract influence the way we understand the relationship between citizens and government in a modern liberal democracy, and what implications does this have for issues of social justice and policy-making?","The concept of equality in Hobbes' social contract has a profound impact on the relationship between citizens and government in a modern liberal democracy. According to Hobbes, the social contract is based on the idea that individuals are equal and have the same natural rights, including the right to life, liberty, and property. This concept of equality is crucial in shaping the relationship between citizens and government, as it emphasizes the importance of protecting individual freedoms and promoting equality. The implications of this concept are significant for issues of social justice and policy-making, as it highlights the need to protect individual freedoms and promote equality.","['https://iep.utm.edu/soc-cont/', 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/sjp.12471', 'https://www.britannica.com/topic/social-contract', 'https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hobbes-moral/', 'https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1467-9248.1994.tb01687.x', 'https://repository.law.umich.edu/context/mlr/article/5428/viewcontent', 'https://oyc.yale.edu/sociology/socy-151/lecture-2', 'https://www.e-ir.info/2012/10/09/the-social-contract-theory-in-a-global-context/', 'https://teachdemocracy.org/images/t2t/pdf/HobbesorLocke.pdf', 'https://open.library.okstate.edu/introphilosophy/chapter/thomas-hobbes-on-the-social-contract/', 'https://iep.utm.edu/soc-cont/', 'https://www.britannica.com/topic/social-contract', 'https://iep.utm.edu/hobmoral/', 'https://www.britannica.com/topic/state-of-nature-political-theory', 'https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hobbes-moral/', 'https://www.battlefields.org/learn/articles/hobbes-locke-and-social-contract', 'https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rousseau/', 'https://www.structural-learning.com/post/social-contract-theory', 'https://repository.law.umich.edu/context/mlr/article/5428/viewcontent', 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09608788.2022.2027340', 'https://iep.utm.edu/soc-cont/', 'https://www.britannica.com/topic/social-contract', 'http://carneades.pomona.edu/2012-SPP/1008-nts.shtml', 'https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/contractarianism/', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_contract', 'https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5725&context=uclrev', 'https://cardinalscholar.bsu.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/87da7767-e9ce-401b-ad7a-33cc5cc6bfa1/content', 'https://opentextbc.ca/ethicsinlawenforcement/chapter/social-contract-theory/', 'https://blogs.worldbank.org/en/governance/can-social-contract-lens-contribute-peacebuilding-and-development', 'https://www.battlefields.org/learn/articles/hobbes-locke-and-social-contract']",politics
"Nevertheless, up to the Westphalian division of Europe, most communities were decentralized and did not share a written normative ordering. Rather, most communities relied on the costume as a standard for judging anomic behavior, and deterrence groups were not organized by the State, but usually, militias made out of voluntaries or mercenaries that would take the maintenance of order into their own hands.
With the urbanization of Europe and the religious wars that plagued the continent throughout three hundred years, a more homogeneous form of organization for the larger community became necessary. It was no longer possible to rely on the openness of different sorts of primary socialization in families and small communities, and hope that conflict could be averted. The State rises, as Michel Foucault would put it, in defense of society. It arises to reinforce a homogeneous form of social relation and identity and to pacify forms of social typification.
At this moment, we can summarize our interpretation of the process of identity formation in Weber as folded in three different stages.
First, we have a process of the meaning constitution that is regarded as a first person perspective of objective social reality. Such perspective takes the shape of a subjective social reality that informs an order of reference-meaning relations to a self, introducing the first ranking of social preferences in types which are had in context to what sort of objects are available. It also constitutes what is “acting towards meaning” for an individual. In this stage of identity formation, ideal types and subjectivity are understood in relation to objects in the world.
Secondly, we have a transformation of the process of the meaning constitution into a process of social action. This process is divided into social action, in terms of primary socialization, and secondary socialization. In primary socialization, we are exposed to non-voluntarist aspects of social relations. Family, social, and geographic placement et cetera, constrain the possibilities of the subjective constitution of meaning and activity. They also constrain the sort of habits and typifications that individuals can experiment with. In that sense, the diversity of meaning appropriations of an individual has a heavy element of destiny, at least, up to the point that this individual encounters someone who has been subject to a different sort of primary socialization and therefore has a different set of reference-meanings constituted. This might operate in individuals as a negative or positive experience, as it transforms some of the former ways in which identity had been constituted, and reconfigures value-orientations and absolutes, or re-enforces previous beliefs, and operate negatively. Here, the closeness or openness to the stranger is somewhat dependent on what sort of objectivity the individual was exposed to in primary socialization.
Social interaction is labeled then in terms of relations and conflict. Both are constituted differently in primary and secondary stages of socialization. In primary socialization, conflict and relations among individuals presuppose a shared grammar for value expressions and a shared conceptualization of absolutes and ideas. Individuals in primary socialization actually share what Habermas calls “communicative reason”, that is, they actually agree upon meaning-object relations and the set of possible meaning-object constitutions that are available. However, social relation and conflict in secondary socialization do not presuppose a shared core of meaning-constitutions. Here, the relation can be of reconstitution of “familiarity”, wherein the emergence of new sorts of constitutions actually enriches and change the scope of values in an individual (who can, ironically, now enter conflict with his/her primary socialization), or, it can be constituted as a conflict. Weber traces the question of the religious wars, for example, to this sort of struggle between primary and secondary socializations. As Hobbes before him, Weber will connect the origin of the State to the necessity to manage the processes of exchanging of values (both economic and social) between different individuals (or other social organisms, such as groups and institutions).","How do the experiences of individuals who grow up in cultures with limited economic resources shape their perceptions of fairness and justice, and what implications do these perceptions have for the development of social policies aimed at reducing economic inequality?","The experiences of individuals growing up in cultures with limited economic resources shape their perceptions of fairness and justice in complex ways, influencing their social identities, unconscious biases, and actual experiences.","['https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5901394/', 'https://www.naco.org/resources/featured/key-terms-definitions-diversity-equity-inclusion', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK425845/', 'https://environment.uw.edu/about/diversity-equity-inclusion/tools-and-additional-resources/glossary-dei-concepts/', 'https://www.naeyc.org/resources/pubs/yc/nov2019/understanding-anti-bias', 'https://cognitiveresearchjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41235-021-00349-3', 'https://nces.ed.gov/npec/pdf/kuh_team_report.pdf', 'https://www.samhsa.gov/sites/default/files/dtac/srb-low-ses_2.pdf', 'https://medium.com/bits-and-behavior/paulo-freires-pedagogy-of-the-oppressed-a-manifesto-on-education-and-social-change-dbd63cd9fc17', 'https://www.vera.org/downloads/publications/for-the-record-unjust-burden-racial-disparities.pdf', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5901394/', 'https://www.naco.org/resources/featured/key-terms-definitions-diversity-equity-inclusion', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK425845/', 'https://environment.uw.edu/about/diversity-equity-inclusion/tools-and-additional-resources/glossary-dei-concepts/', 'https://www.naeyc.org/resources/pubs/yc/nov2019/understanding-anti-bias', 'https://cognitiveresearchjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41235-021-00349-3', 'https://nces.ed.gov/npec/pdf/kuh_team_report.pdf', 'https://www.samhsa.gov/sites/default/files/dtac/srb-low-ses_2.pdf', 'https://medium.com/bits-and-behavior/paulo-freires-pedagogy-of-the-oppressed-a-manifesto-on-education-and-social-change-dbd63cd9fc17', 'https://www.vera.org/downloads/publications/for-the-record-unjust-burden-racial-disparities.pdf', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5901394/', 'https://www.naco.org/resources/featured/key-terms-definitions-diversity-equity-inclusion', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK425845/', 'https://environment.uw.edu/about/diversity-equity-inclusion/tools-and-additional-resources/glossary-dei-concepts/', 'https://www.naeyc.org/resources/pubs/yc/nov2019/understanding-anti-bias', 'https://cognitiveresearchjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41235-021-00349-3', 'https://nces.ed.gov/npec/pdf/kuh_team_report.pdf', 'https://www.samhsa.gov/sites/default/files/dtac/srb-low-ses_2.pdf', 'https://medium.com/bits-and-behavior/paulo-freires-pedagogy-of-the-oppressed-a-manifesto-on-education-and-social-change-dbd63cd9fc17', 'https://www.vera.org/downloads/publications/for-the-record-unjust-burden-racial-disparities.pdf']",politics

"Nevertheless, up to the Westphalian division of Europe, most communities were decentralized and did not share a written normative ordering. Rather, most communities relied on the costume as a standard for judging anomic behavior, and deterrence groups were not organized by the State, but usually, militias made out of voluntaries or mercenaries that would take the maintenance of order into their own hands.
With the urbanization of Europe and the religious wars that plagued the continent throughout three hundred years, a more homogeneous form of organization for the larger community became necessary. It was no longer possible to rely on the openness of different sorts of primary socialization in families and small communities, and hope that conflict could be averted. The State rises, as Michel Foucault would put it, in defense of society. It arises to reinforce a homogeneous form of social relation and identity and to pacify forms of social typification.
At this moment, we can summarize our interpretation of the process of identity formation in Weber as folded in three different stages.
First, we have a process of the meaning constitution that is regarded as a first person perspective of objective social reality. Such perspective takes the shape of a subjective social reality that informs an order of reference-meaning relations to a self, introducing the first ranking of social preferences in types which are had in context to what sort of objects are available. It also constitutes what is “acting towards meaning” for an individual. In this stage of identity formation, ideal types and subjectivity are understood in relation to objects in the world.
Secondly, we have a transformation of the process of the meaning constitution into a process of social action. This process is divided into social action, in terms of primary socialization, and secondary socialization. In primary socialization, we are exposed to non-voluntarist aspects of social relations. Family, social, and geographic placement et cetera, constrain the possibilities of the subjective constitution of meaning and activity. They also constrain the sort of habits and typifications that individuals can experiment with. In that sense, the diversity of meaning appropriations of an individual has a heavy element of destiny, at least, up to the point that this individual encounters someone who has been subject to a different sort of primary socialization and therefore has a different set of reference-meanings constituted. This might operate in individuals as a negative or positive experience, as it transforms some of the former ways in which identity had been constituted, and reconfigures value-orientations and absolutes, or re-enforces previous beliefs, and operate negatively. Here, the closeness or openness to the stranger is somewhat dependent on what sort of objectivity the individual was exposed to in primary socialization.
Social interaction is labeled then in terms of relations and conflict. Both are constituted differently in primary and secondary stages of socialization. In primary socialization, conflict and relations among individuals presuppose a shared grammar for value expressions and a shared conceptualization of absolutes and ideas. Individuals in primary socialization actually share what Habermas calls “communicative reason”, that is, they actually agree upon meaning-object relations and the set of possible meaning-object constitutions that are available. However, social relation and conflict in secondary socialization do not presuppose a shared core of meaning-constitutions. Here, the relation can be of reconstitution of “familiarity”, wherein the emergence of new sorts of constitutions actually enriches and change the scope of values in an individual (who can, ironically, now enter conflict with his/her primary socialization), or, it can be constituted as a conflict.

(Cunningham, p. 246)",What was the primary factor that led to the decline of Rhode Island's colonial-era economies in the late 18th century?,"The primary factor that led to the decline of Rhode Island's colonial-era economies in the late 18th century was likely the decline of the colonial trade system, particularly the decline of the triangular trade. This trade system, which involved the exchange of goods such as rum, candles, and fish between Europe, Africa, and the Americas, was a major engine of economic growth for Rhode Island and other colonial ports. However, by the late 18th century, the triangular trade was in decline due to a variety of factors, including the decline of the slave trade, the rise of industrialization in Europe, and the increasing competition from other colonial ports.","['https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2015/09/28/04/53/sp082500', 'https://live.laborstats.alaska.gov/pop/estimates/pub/pophistory.pdf', 'https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-history-of-womens-work-and-wages-and-how-it-has-created-success-for-us-all/', 'https://www.facinghistory.org/resource-library/religion-colonial-america-trends-regulations-beliefs', 'https://nces.ed.gov/pubs93/93442.pdf', 'https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/tobacco-in-colonial-virginia/', 'https://newporthistory.org/about/newport-history/', 'https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/new-england-mid-atlantic/commercial-fishing/brief-history-groundfishing-industry-new-england', 'https://www.lamoncloa.gob.es/lang/en/espana/historyandculture/history/Paginas/index.aspx', 'https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/haventohome/haven-century.html', 'https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2015/09/28/04/53/sp082500', 'https://live.laborstats.alaska.gov/pop/estimates/pub/pophistory.pdf', 'https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-history-of-womens-work-and-wages-and-how-it-has-created-success-for-us-all/', 'https://www.facinghistory.org/resource-library/religion-colonial-america-trends-regulations-beliefs', 'https://nces.ed.gov/pubs93/93442.pdf', 'https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/tobacco-in-colonial-virginia/', 'https://newporthistory.org/about/newport-history/', 'https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/new-england-mid-atlantic/commercial-fishing/brief-history-groundfishing-industry-new-england', 'https://www.lamoncloa.gob.es/lang/en/espana/historyandculture/history/Paginas/index.aspx', 'https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/haventohome/haven-century.html', 'https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2015/09/28/04/53/sp082500', 'https://live.laborstats.alaska.gov/pop/estimates/pub/pophistory.pdf', 'https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-history-of-womens-work-and-wages-and-how-it-has-created-success-for-us-all/', 'https://www.facinghistory.org/resource-library/religion-colonial-america-trends-regulations-beliefs', 'https://nces.ed.gov/pubs93/93442.pdf', 'https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/tobacco-in-colonial-virginia/', 'https://newporthistory.org/about/newport-history/', 'https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/new-england-mid-atlantic/commercial-fishing/brief-history-groundfishing-industry-new-england', 'https://www.lamoncloa.gob.es/lang/en/espana/historyandculture/history/Paginas/index.aspx', 'https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/haventohome/haven-century.html']",politics

What is today referred to as the Democratic Republican Party did not exist as such under that name.
""The party name which the Jeffersonians used most commonly in self-designation was Republican.

""No precise date can be given for the establishment of the Republican party, for it did not spring suddenly into being, and even those leaders most intimately involved in its formation were not fully aware of what they were creating. The beginnings of what in course of time became the Republican party can be found in the Second Congress in the congressional faction that contemporaries referred to as the 'republican interest.' . . . An examination of roll calls during the Second Congress indicates that a voting bloc was forming around Madison in opposition to another bloc that united in support of Hamilton's program. While only about half of the membership of the House could be identified with one or the other of these factions, two such groups had not been observable in the First Congress."" (Cunningham, p. 241)
""As members of Congress defended their legislative records and sought reelection, they took to the electorate the issues and the disputes that had divided Congress, and they tended in their campaigns for reelection to impart to the voters something of the partisanship that was developing in Congress. Thus, the party divisions in Congress filtered down to the voters through the electoral process, and voters came to align along the lines that divisions in Congress had marked out. In this process the congressional factions acquired the mass followings in the county necessary to transform them from capital factions into national political parties."" (Cunningham, p. 244)

Policy makers, politicians, journalists and academic stress the importance of a cohesive society, with room for diversity (according to ethnicity/race/origin, gender, class, religion, ability, skill and sexuality). Diversity policies are meant to enhance social cohesion, but in practice they oftentimes do not work out as intended or planned. This is a problem because the idea that policies are 'failing', and that part of the people are excluded, undermines trust in and the working of democracy. The dilemma is that, in order to be able to address all citizens equally, they must be treated unequally. In this course we focus on the period since 1900 and ask how different actors have dealt with diversity, conflicting interests, power and identities. We will study the histories of ‘diversity management’ from an intersectional perspective. This means we analyze how categories of power and identity, such as ethnicity/race/origin, gender, class, religion, ability, skill and sexuality intersected. We will study these histories on different levels (local, national, global) and from the perspective of different actors (policymakers, self-advocates and claim makers, street-level bureaucrats, diplomats). The course will include excursions to (more and less organized) archives.

"This course is part of the (Res)MA History Programme. Students from within the specialization the course belongs to have right of way. It is not accessible for BA students.
Policy makers, politicians, journalists and academic stress the importance of a cohesive society, with room for diversity (according to ethnicity/race/origin, gender, class, religion, ability, skill and sexuality). Diversity policies are meant to enhance social cohesion, but in practice they oftentimes do not work out as intended or planned. This is a problem because the idea that policies are 'failing', and that part of the people are excluded, undermines trust in and the working of democracy. The dilemma is that, in order to be able to address all citizens equally, they must be treated unequally. In this course we focus on the period since 1900 and ask how different actors have dealt with diversity, conflicting interests, power and identities. We will study the histories of ‘diversity management’ from an intersectional perspective. This means we analyze how categories of power and identity, such as ethnicity/race/origin, gender, class, religion, ability, skill and sexuality intersected. We will study these histories on different levels (local, national, global) and from the perspective of different actors (policymakers, self-advocates and claim makers, street-level bureaucrats, diplomats). The course will include excursions to (more and less organized) archives.

"The Ministry of Community and Territory Development of Ukraine reports women make up more than half of the national population. Nevertheless, critically few Ukrainian women hold the positions requiring political decision-making.
A politician, first of all, is a leader, and the leadership does not make difference between men and women. It is not a matter of gender. True leadership means responsibility and a complex burden. These are the challenges one needs to manage to make others follow.
Unfortunately, stereotypes, still firmly established in Ukrainian society, are perceived not as discrimination but as a part of culture.
This is quite strange in terms of historical perspective. After all, for at least the last hundred years, equality between men and women has been enshrined at the state level. There were 36% women in the composition of the last Soviet Council of the Ukrainian SSR, which number decreased 10-fold immediately in the first Ukrainian Parliament, amounting to only 2.7% (1990-1994 convocation). OPORA Public Network Study Report regarding women participation in the 2020 Local Elections, demonstrates the lack of general declarative norms on equality to ensure actually the same.
The Government lacks women: cultural stigmas and expectations of changes
In addition, the priority of opportunities for men is superior. Moreover, 51% of Ukrainians still believe that fulfilling family obligations leave no time for women for government appointments.
Public opinion research shows society’s expectation of woman’s priority for family obligations, and 70% of men believe the woman’s most important role is to take care of own home and family. Women’s average housework time is twice this one for men (29 vs. 15 hours per week). That is, the very public expectations cause unequal treatment and cannot but influence women’s choice of priorities in life.
Given such an attitude in the modern Ukrainian society towards the role of women in politics there is an increasing belief that Ukraine lacks a party representing the interests of women. About half of the respondents in the Rating Sociological Group survey on the role of women in the Ukrainian society stated the latter are underrepresented in the Government, the Verkhovna Rada, and local authorities.
Eighty-two percent support the idea of women engaging in politics, 12% oppose this. When evaluating the effectiveness of both gender representatives in a political capacity, the respondents agreed that gender does not matter in people’s or local deputy performance. That is, Rating Group survey results showed once again that men and women tend to see changes in the traditional roles of men and women.
Meanwhile, for several years in a row, the most recognizable people’s deputies among women in Ukrainian society are Yulia Tymoshenko (97% of respondents know her), Natalia Korolevska (76%), and Iryna Herashchenko (66%). Less than 60% of respondents know other female deputies.
82% Ukrainians support women’s intention to come toward power
It becomes obvious that Ukraine needs effective female politicians. According to the results of the parliamentary elections 2020, the share of female deputies is already 20.8% (88 women out of 423 deputies). However, according to the Inter-Parliamentary Union, it rates only 100thamong 193 countries as to the number of women in parliament. https://bit.ly/3n1m91D For comparison, the average rate in Europe is 27.7%, the Scandinavian countries – 41.4%, and the parliaments worldwide –24%.
Therefore, the baseline for growth is definitely present. That is why it draws consolation when young political forces with a female leader appear in the country in response to the needs of society. The National Platform, led by Kateryna Odarchenko, is one of such forces and currently participates in Kherson region political rallies.
The party goes to the Verkhovna Rada for the first time. It was established in 2020, following the collection of more than 14.000 signatures across Ukraine, and focuses on the intensification of direct democracy, democratic values, ??and human priority in the state. That is why the party contributes to using “local initiatives” mechanism for social advocacy of communities in direct dialogue of the citizens with authorities, and effective representation of their position on the top-notch of society.
Thus, one of the reasons for social issues stalling at the state level and insufficient protection of the rights of women and children is the lack of women in the corridors of power. However, society starts realizing that the lack of female representation in power not only contradicts the values ??of democratic development but also hinders the sustainable economic growth in the country, which infuses 20 million Ukrainian women with hope.","What are the potential consequences of a government's lack of commitment to promoting gender equality on the overall economic growth of the country, particularly in a society where women are still expected to prioritize family obligations over career advancement?","The potential consequences of a government's lack of commitment to promoting gender equality on the overall economic growth of the country, particularly in a society where women are still expected to prioritize family obligations over career advancement, include:

1. Reduced economic diversification and income equality: When women are not empowered to participate in the workforce, economies may become less diversified and income inequality may increase, leading to reduced economic growth.
2. Lower economic productivity: Gender equality can enhance economic productivity, improve development outcomes for the next generation, and make institutions and policies more efficient.
3. Reduced GDP growth: Closing the gender pay gap can lead to a 0-0.2% increase in GDP per capita over the 2030-2050 period, which may have a significant impact on economic growth.
4. Increased gender-based violence: Gender-based violence has direct and indirect costs for families, communities, and economies, and can impact democratic governance, development, and public health.
5. Reduced female participation in the workforce: When women are not empowered to participate in the workforce, economies may miss out on the skills and talents of half of the population, leading to reduced economic growth.
6. Reduced economic empowerment: Gender equality in decision-making has positive economic consequences, and increasing gender equality and women's economic empowerment can lead to increased economic growth.
7. Reduced economic development: More development leads to more gender equality, and vice versa, which can lead to reduced economic growth if gender equality is not prioritized.

Overall, a government's lack of commitment to promoting gender equality can have significant consequences for the overall economic growth of the country, particularly in societies where women are still expected to prioritize family obligations over career advancement.","['https://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/economic-empowerment/facts-and-figures', 'https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2012/03/revenga.htm', 'https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/employment-and-growth/how-advancing-womens-equality-can-add-12-trillion-to-global-growth', 'https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/WP/2020/English/wpiea2020119-print-pdf.ashx', 'https://eige.europa.eu/newsroom/economic-benefits-gender-equality?language_content_entity=en', 'https://www.intereconomics.eu/contents/year/2017/number/1/article/gender-equality-in-decision-making-positions-the-efficiency-gains.html', 'https://ourworldindata.org/economic-inequality-by-gender', 'https://www.sciencespo.fr/kuwait-program/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/KSP_Paper_Award_Fall_2015_AL-RAKHIS_Monira.pdf', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/National-Strategy-on-Gender-Equity-and-Equality.pdf', 'https://www.state.gov/reports/united-states-strategy-on-global-womens-economic-security/', 'https://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/economic-empowerment/facts-and-figures', 'https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2012/03/revenga.htm', 'https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/employment-and-growth/how-advancing-womens-equality-can-add-12-trillion-to-global-growth', 'https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/WP/2020/English/wpiea2020119-print-pdf.ashx', 'https://eige.europa.eu/newsroom/economic-benefits-gender-equality?language_content_entity=en', 'https://www.intereconomics.eu/contents/year/2017/number/1/article/gender-equality-in-decision-making-positions-the-efficiency-gains.html', 'https://ourworldindata.org/economic-inequality-by-gender', 'https://www.sciencespo.fr/kuwait-program/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/KSP_Paper_Award_Fall_2015_AL-RAKHIS_Monira.pdf', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/National-Strategy-on-Gender-Equity-and-Equality.pdf', 'https://www.state.gov/reports/united-states-strategy-on-global-womens-economic-security/', 'https://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/economic-empowerment/facts-and-figures', 'https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2012/03/revenga.htm', 'https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/employment-and-growth/how-advancing-womens-equality-can-add-12-trillion-to-global-growth', 'https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/WP/2020/English/wpiea2020119-print-pdf.ashx', 'https://eige.europa.eu/newsroom/economic-benefits-gender-equality?language_content_entity=en', 'https://www.intereconomics.eu/contents/year/2017/number/1/article/gender-equality-in-decision-making-positions-the-efficiency-gains.html', 'https://ourworldindata.org/economic-inequality-by-gender', 'https://www.sciencespo.fr/kuwait-program/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/KSP_Paper_Award_Fall_2015_AL-RAKHIS_Monira.pdf', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/National-Strategy-on-Gender-Equity-and-Equality.pdf', 'https://www.state.gov/reports/united-states-strategy-on-global-womens-economic-security/']",politics
"The Ministry of Community and Territory Development of Ukraine reports women make up more than half of the national population. Nevertheless, critically few Ukrainian women hold the positions requiring political decision-making.
A politician, first of all, is a leader, and the leadership does not make difference between men and women. It is not a matter of gender. True leadership means responsibility and a complex burden. These are the challenges one needs to manage to make others follow.
Unfortunately, stereotypes, still firmly established in Ukrainian society, are perceived not as discrimination but as a part of culture.
This is quite strange in terms of historical perspective. After all, for at least the last hundred years, equality between men and women has been enshrined at the state level. There were 36% women in the composition of the last Soviet Council of the Ukrainian SSR, which number decreased 10-fold immediately in the first Ukrainian Parliament, amounting to only 2.7% (1990-1994 convocation). OPORA Public Network Study Report regarding women participation in the 2020 Local Elections, demonstrates the lack of general declarative norms on equality to ensure actually the same.
The Government lacks women: cultural stigmas and expectations of changes
In addition, the priority of opportunities for men is superior. Moreover, 51% of Ukrainians still believe that fulfilling family obligations leave no time for women for government appointments.
Public opinion research shows society’s expectation of woman’s priority for family obligations, and 70% of men believe the woman’s most important role is to take care of own home and family. Women’s average housework time is twice this one for men (29 vs. 15 hours per week). That is, the very public expectations cause unequal treatment and cannot but influence women’s choice of priorities in life.
Given such an attitude in the modern Ukrainian society towards the role of women in politics there is an increasing belief that Ukraine lacks a party representing the interests of women. About half of the respondents in the Rating Sociological Group survey on the role of women in the Ukrainian society stated the latter are underrepresented in the Government, the Verkhovna Rada, and local authorities.
Eighty-two percent support the idea of women engaging in politics, 12% oppose this. When evaluating the effectiveness of both gender representatives in a political capacity, the respondents agreed that gender does not matter in people’s or local deputy performance. That is, Rating Group survey results showed once again that men and women tend to see changes in the traditional roles of men and women.
Meanwhile, for several years in a row, the most recognizable people’s deputies among women in Ukrainian society are Yulia Tymoshenko (97% of respondents know her), Natalia Korolevska (76%), and Iryna Herashchenko (66%). Less than 60% of respondents know other female deputies.
82% Ukrainians support women’s intention to come toward power
It becomes obvious that Ukraine needs effective female politicians. According to the results of the parliamentary elections 2020, the share of female deputies is already 20.8% (88 women out of 423 deputies). However, according to the Inter-Parliamentary Union, it rates only 100thamong 193 countries as to the number of women in parliament. https://bit.ly/3n1m91D For comparison, the average rate in Europe is 27.7%, the Scandinavian countries – 41.4%, and the parliaments worldwide –24%.
Therefore, the baseline for growth is definitely present. That is why it draws consolation when young political forces with a female leader appear in the country in response to the needs of society. The National Platform, led by Kateryna Odarchenko, is one of such forces and currently participates in Kherson region political rallies.
The party goes to the Verkhovna Rada for the first time.

The search results suggest that increased women's representation could lead to more targeted and effective infrastructure development in rural areas, as women are more likely to prioritize the needs of their communities and address the challenges faced by rural residents. This could include improving access to healthcare, education, and economic opportunities, as well as addressing the specific infrastructure needs of rural areas, such as transportation and energy infrastructure.

The search results also highlight the importance of addressing the root causes of poverty and inequality in rural areas, including lack of access to education, healthcare, and economic opportunities. Increased women's representation could help to address these issues by promoting policies and programs that support the empowerment of women and girls, and by providing more opportunities for women to participate in decision-making processes.

In terms of the daily lives of Ukrainian citizens, increased women's representation could lead to a range of positive outcomes, including improved access to healthcare and education, increased economic opportunities, and a greater sense of community and social cohesion. Women's representation could also help to promote more inclusive and participatory decision-making processes, which could lead to more effective and sustainable solutions to the challenges faced by rural communities.

Overall, the potential impact of increased women's representation in Ukrainian politics on infrastructure development in rural areas is significant, and could have far-reaching benefits for the daily lives of Ukrainian citizens.","['https://neighbourhood-enlargement.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2023-11/SWD_2023_699%20Ukraine%20report.pdf', 'https://ourworldindata.org/charts', 'https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2617', 'https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/drc/overview', 'https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/report/2022/The-Sustainable-Development-Goals-Report-2022.pdf', 'https://press.un.org/en/2023/gaef3590.doc.htm', 'https://www.un.org/en/observances/rural-women-day', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/budget_fy2023.pdf', 'https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/2015_MDG_Report/pdf/MDG%202015%20rev%20(July%201).pdf', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/budget_fy2024.pdf', 'https://ourworldindata.org/charts', 'https://www.un.org/en/observances/rural-women-day', 'https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/drc/overview', 'https://www.un.org/en/exhibits/page/sdgs-17-goals-transform-world', 'https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/poverty/overview', 'https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2617', 'https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/report/2022/The-Sustainable-Development-Goals-Report-2022.pdf', 'https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/GlobalTrends_2040.pdf', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/02/16/executive-order-on-further-advancing-racial-equity-and-support-for-underserved-communities-through-the-federal-government/', 'https://neighbourhood-enlargement.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2023-11/SWD_2023_699%20Ukraine%20report.pdf']",politics

"The Ministry of Community and Territory Development of Ukraine reports women make up more than half of the national population. Nevertheless, critically few Ukrainian women hold the positions requiring political decision-making.
A politician, first of all, is a leader, and the leadership does not make difference between men and women. It is not a matter of gender. True leadership means responsibility and a complex burden. These are the challenges one needs to manage to make others follow.
Unfortunately, stereotypes, still firmly established in Ukrainian society, are perceived not as discrimination but as a part of culture.
This is quite strange in terms of historical perspective. After all, for at least the last hundred years, equality between men and women has been enshrined at the state level. There were 36% women in the composition of the last Soviet Council of the Ukrainian SSR, which number decreased 10-fold immediately in the first Ukrainian Parliament, amounting to only 2.7% (1990-1994 convocation). OPORA Public Network Study Report regarding women participation in the 2020 Local Elections, demonstrates the lack of general declarative norms on equality to ensure actually the same.
The Government lacks women: cultural stigmas and expectations of changes
In addition, the priority of opportunities for men is superior. Moreover, 51% of Ukrainians still believe that fulfilling family obligations leave no time for women for government appointments.
Public opinion research shows society’s expectation of woman’s priority for family obligations, and 70% of men believe the woman’s most important role is to take care of own home and family. Women’s average housework time is twice this one for men (29 vs. 15 hours per week). That is, the very public expectations cause unequal treatment and cannot but influence women’s choice of priorities in life.
Given such an attitude in the modern Ukrainian society towards the role of women in politics there is an increasing belief that Ukraine lacks a party representing the interests of women. About half of the respondents in the Rating Sociological Group survey on the role of women in the Ukrainian society stated the latter are underrepresented in the Government, the Verkhovna Rada, and local authorities.
Eighty-two percent support the idea of women engaging in politics, 12% oppose this. When evaluating the effectiveness of both gender representatives in a political capacity, the respondents agreed that gender does not matter in people’s or local deputy performance. That is, Rating Group survey results showed once again that men and women tend to see changes in the traditional roles of men and women.
Meanwhile, for several years in a row, the most recognizable people’s deputies among women in Ukrainian society are Yulia Tymoshenko (97% of respondents know her), Natalia Korolevska (76%), and Iryna Herashchenko (66%). Less than 60% of respondents know other female deputies.
82% Ukrainians support women’s intention to come toward power
It becomes obvious that Ukraine needs effective female politicians. According to the results of the parliamentary elections 2020, the share of female deputies is already 20.8% (88 women out of 423 deputies). However, according to the Inter-Parliamentary Union, it rates only 100thamong 193 countries as to the number of women in parliament. https://bit.ly/3n1m91D For comparison, the average rate in Europe is 27.7%, the Scandinavian countries – 41.4%, and the parliaments worldwide –24%.
Therefore, the baseline for growth is definitely present. That is why it draws consolation when young political forces with a female leader appear in the country in response to the needs of society. The National Platform, led by Kateryna Odarchenko, is one of such forces and currently participates in Kherson region political rallies.
The party goes to the Verkhovna Rada for the first time. It was established in 2020, following the collection of more than 14.000 signatures across Ukraine, and focuses on the intensification of direct democracy, democratic values, ??and human priority in the state. That is why the party contributes to using “local initiatives” mechanism for social advocacy of communities in direct dialogue of the citizens with authorities, and effective representation of their position on the top-notch of society.
Thus, one of the reasons for social issues stalling at the state level and insufficient protection of the rights of women and children is the lack of women in the corridors of power. However, society starts realizing that the lack of female representation in power not only contradicts the values ??of democratic development but also hinders the sustainable economic growth in the country, which infuses 20 million Ukrainian women with hope.","How do Ukraine's economic growth prospects change if the country's government adopts a policy of increasing women's employment in traditionally male-dominated industries, similar to the approach taken by some Scandinavian countries?","The economic benefits of increasing women's employment in traditionally male-dominated industries in Ukraine would likely include:

1. Increased GDP: As women enter male-dominated industries, they will contribute to the economy through their labor, leading to increased GDP.
2. Reduced Gender Pay Gap: As women gain experience and skills in male-dominated industries, they will likely earn higher salaries, reducing the gender pay gap.
3. Increased Tax Revenue: As women enter the workforce, they will pay taxes, contributing to the government's revenue.
4. Improved Economic Security: Women will have increased economic security as they benefit from working in jobs that pay higher salaries.
5. Increased Entrepreneurship: As women gain experience and skills in male-dominated industries, they may be more likely to start their own businesses, contributing to entrepreneurship and innovation.
6. Reduced Unemployment: As women enter the workforce, they will reduce unemployment rates, leading to a more stable economy.
7. Increased Diversity: As women enter male-dominated industries, they will bring new perspectives and ideas, leading to increased diversity and innovation.
8. Improved Social and Economic Outcomes: As women gain economic independence, they will have improved social and economic outcomes, such as increased access to education and healthcare.

However, there are also potential challenges and barriers to increasing women's employment in traditionally male-dominated industries in Ukraine, such as:

1. Stereotypes and Bias: Women may face stereotypes and bias in male-dominated industries, making it difficult for them to gain acceptance and advancement.
2. Lack of Role Models: There may be a lack of role models for women in male-dominated industries, making it difficult for them to see themselves in these roles.
3. Limited Access to Education and Training: Women may have limited access to education and training in male-dominated industries, making it difficult for them to gain the skills and knowledge needed to succeed.
4. Family and Caregiving Responsibilities: Women may have family and caregiving responsibilities that make it difficult for them to balance work and family life, leading to reduced participation in the workforce.
5. Cultural and Social Norms: Cultural and social norms may discourage women from entering male-dominated industries, making it difficult for them to gain acceptance and advancement.

To address these challenges and barriers, the Ukrainian government could implement policies and programs to increase women's employment in traditionally male-dominated industries, such as:

1. Providing education and training programs specifically for women in male-dominated industries.
2. Implementing policies to reduce gender bias and stereotypes in the workplace.
3. Providing childcare and family support services to help women balance work and family life.
4. Encouraging women to take on leadership roles and providing mentorship and support.
5. Implementing policies to increase diversity and inclusion in the workplace.

By addressing these challenges and barriers, the Ukrainian government can increase women's employment in traditionally male-dominated industries, leading to increased economic growth, reduced gender pay gap, and improved social and economic outcomes.","['https://www.americanprogress.org/article/playbook-for-the-advancement-of-women-in-the-economy/expanding-womens-access-to-male-dominated-jobs/', 'https://www.catalyst.org/research/women-in-male-dominated-industries-and-occupations/', 'https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/gender-norms-and-womens-economic-empowerment-low-income-countries-what-we-learned-reviewing-evidence', 'https://blogs.worldbank.org/en/jobs/With-legal-restrictions-lifted-it-is-time-to-break-soft-barriers-to-womens-employment-in-Azerbaijan', 'https://www.nationalacademies.org/news/2021/08/direct-financial-support-access-to-male-dominated-jobs-and-investing-in-child-care-can-increase-womens-participation-in-post-covid-workforce-says-new-expert-consultation', 'https://www.aauw.org/resources/research/the-stem-gap/', 'https://www.epi.org/publication/womens-work-and-the-gender-pay-gap-how-discrimination-societal-norms-and-other-forces-affect-womens-occupational-choices-and-their-pay/', 'http://www.maine.gov/governor/mills/official_documents/executive-orders/2024-05-executive-order-7-order-regarding-women-construction', 'https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-history-of-womens-work-and-wages-and-how-it-has-created-success-for-us-all/', 'https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-gender-gap-report-2023/in-full/gender-gaps-in-the-workforce/', 'https://www.state.gov/reports/united-states-strategy-on-global-womens-economic-security/', 'https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2013/sdn1310.pdf', 'https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-gender-gap-report-2023/in-full/gender-gaps-in-the-workforce/', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/20/upshot/as-women-take-over-a-male-dominated-field-the-pay-drops.html', 'https://www.international.gc.ca/trade-commerce/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/ukraine/summary_gba-acs_sommaire.aspx?lang=eng', 'https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/gender/publication/breaking-barriers-female-entrepreneurs-who-cross-over-to-male-dominated-sectors', 'https://www.oecd.org/greengrowth/40881538.pdf', 'https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2021/04/01/stem-jobs-see-uneven-progress-in-increasing-gender-racial-and-ethnic-diversity/', 'https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/africa-gender-innovation-lab', 'https://www.ilo.org/media/354126/download']",politics
"Many people worldwide saw their individual politico-societal consciousness influenced by role models, notably leaders of the various independence and liberation movements. One of the most prominent examples is Che Guevara who was admired by many people living in different countries and political systems. He became an icon for social movements that were incompatible with or challenged the existing raison d’état – in both blocs, East and West. In some East European countries governments organised a quasi-religious cult around him that should help attract the youth towards official ‘international’ socialism. At the same time, however, Guevara’s legend implied and inspired visions of socialist revolution that might call into question the established model of ‘real socialism’ and the doctrine of ‘peaceful coexistence’. A similar phenomenon was the widespread fascination with Chinese leader Mao Zedong. His version of a ‘cultural revolution’ also influenced the cultural and political perception outside of China. He became an icon for the Sino-Soviet split within the socialist camp which partially resulted from the positive reception of Mao’s vision by ‘third world countries’ which saw Maoism as a viable alternative to the Soviet model. Some icons were even claimed by both, the establishment and the critics, as was the case with Nelson Mandela and the global Anti-Apartheid Movement.
Similarly, the African-American Civil Rights Movement within the U.S. was claimed and interpreted in favour of very different causes throughout the world: For the Soviet-led states the African-American struggle was evidence for the barbarism inherent to Capitalism, while the simultaneously pan-African movements were inspired to actively search for a post-colonial African identity.
How did these expressions of the new social and political movements manifest themselves on different political levels and in different political spaces? How were these changes perceived by the Western and Eastern bloc respectively? For instance, how did the soviets portray the western student and hippie movements and, conversely, how did the Western media cover the 1968 Polish political crisis? In which ways and to what extent was the traditional international state order with its emphasis on nation states and governmental agency already challenged during the Cold War by transnational issues such as human rights, disarmament, or environmental protection? Did the accession of former colonies to the United Nations, the later so-called (and self-labelled) ‘third world countries’, to their actual ‘emancipation’? And if one can indeed speak of a new kind of self-determination, was it primarily of a political, cultural and/or economic nature? What efforts are (and have been) made by governments and companies alike to maintain global asymmetries favouring rich industrial countries such as the USA?

The crisis may have left lasting scars beyond its well-documented effects on growth trends, such as reduced fertility rates, increased income inequality, and decreased investment in renewable energy. These effects can lead to a decrease in a country's ability to adapt to and mitigate the effects of climate change, as well as a decrease in its long-term economic security.","['https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2018/10/03/blog-lasting-effects-the-global-economic-recovery-10-years-after-the-crisis', 'https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/great-recession-and-its-aftermath', 'https://www.nber.org/digest/oct14/longer-term-consequences-financial-crisis', 'https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2019/642253/EPRS_BRI%282019%29642253_EN.pdf', 'https://www.britannica.com/money/financial-crisis-of-2007-2008/Effects-and-aftermath-of-the-crisis', 'https://www.frbsf.org/research-and-insights/publications/economic-letter/2020/11/permanent-and-transitory-effects-of-2008-09-recession', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/a-guide-to-the-financial-crisis--10-years-later/2018/09/10/114b76ba-af10-11e8-a20b-5f4f84429666_story.html', 'https://www.brookings.edu/articles/unemployment-and-earnings-losses-a-look-at-long-term-impacts-of-the-great-recession-on-american-workers/', 'https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/09/17/the-real-cost-of-the-2008-financial-crisis', 'https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/great-recession.asp', 'https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2018/10/03/blog-lasting-effects-the-global-economic-recovery-10-years-after-the-crisis', 'https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/short-termism-and-the-threat-from-climate-change', 'https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2017/09/19/world-economic-outlook-october-2017', 'https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/GlobalTrends_2040.pdf', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/22/opinion/sunday/lessons-for-climate-change-in-the-2008-recession.html', 'https://stanleycenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/v9-RRCC-GlobalFinance320.pdf', 'https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P231120.pdf', 'https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/resources/fact-sheets/ab-32-global-warming-solutions-act-2006', 'https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41294-023-00209-7', 'https://www.nber.org/digest/oct14/longer-term-consequences-financial-crisis', 'https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2018/10/03/blog-lasting-effects-the-global-economic-recovery-10-years-after-the-crisis', 'https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/short-termism-and-the-threat-from-climate-change', 'https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2017/09/19/world-economic-outlook-october-2017', 'https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/GlobalTrends_2040.pdf', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/22/opinion/sunday/lessons-for-climate-change-in-the-2008-recession.html', 'https://stanleycenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/v9-RRCC-GlobalFinance320.pdf', 'https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P231120.pdf', 'https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/resources/fact-sheets/ab-32-global-warming-solutions-act-2006', 'https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41294-023-00209-7', 'https://www.nber.org/digest/oct14/longer-term-consequences-financial-crisis']",politics
"Many people worldwide saw their individual politico-societal consciousness influenced by role models, notably leaders of the various independence and liberation movements. One of the most prominent examples is Che Guevara who was admired by many people living in different countries and political systems. He became an icon for social movements that were incompatible with or challenged the existing raison d’état – in both blocs, East and West. In some East European countries governments organised a quasi-religious cult around him that should help attract the youth towards official ‘international’ socialism. At the same time, however, Guevara’s legend implied and inspired visions of socialist revolution that might call into question the established model of ‘real socialism’ and the doctrine of ‘peaceful coexistence’. A similar phenomenon was the widespread fascination with Chinese leader Mao Zedong. His version of a ‘cultural revolution’ also influenced the cultural and political perception outside of China. He became an icon for the Sino-Soviet split within the socialist camp which partially resulted from the positive reception of Mao’s vision by ‘third world countries’ which saw Maoism as a viable alternative to the Soviet model. Some icons were even claimed by both, the establishment and the critics, as was the case with Nelson Mandela and the global Anti-Apartheid Movement.
Similarly, the African-American Civil Rights Movement within the U.S. was claimed and interpreted in favour of very different causes throughout the world: For the Soviet-led states the African-American struggle was evidence for the barbarism inherent to Capitalism, while the simultaneously pan-African movements were inspired to actively search for a post-colonial African identity.
How did these expressions of the new social and political movements manifest themselves on different political levels and in different political spaces? How were these changes perceived by the Western and Eastern bloc respectively? For instance, how did the soviets portray the western student and hippie movements and, conversely, how did the Western media cover the 1968 Polish political crisis? In which ways and to what extent was the traditional international state order with its emphasis on nation states and governmental agency already challenged during the Cold War by transnational issues such as human rights, disarmament, or environmental protection? Did the accession of former colonies to the United Nations, the later so-called (and self-labelled) ‘third world countries’, to their actual ‘emancipation’? And if one can indeed speak of a new kind of self-determination, was it primarily of a political, cultural and/or economic nature? What efforts are (and have been) made by governments and companies alike to maintain global asymmetries favouring rich industrial countries such as the USA? In this context, what role did the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) play and is still playing until the present day?
New Partnerships in the Cold War: Chances for Political Empowerment?
After 1945 ‘old Europe’ saw a slow but sustained power loss that became most visible in the break-up of European colonial empires from the 1950s onwards and the gradual loss of global domination and agency, at least in the classical sense of hard power projection. The European global ‘rear-guard battles’ from direct rule over other nations, notably the decolonisation wars (e.g. the Indonesian War of Independence, the Suez Crisis, the Algerian War, and the Vietnam War), meant a step towards empowerment of formerly colonised peoples soon after World War II.

The Federalist Party
The Federalist Party was dominated by a man who never actually ran for public office in the United States - Alexander Hamilton. ""Alexander Hamilton was, writes Marcus Cunliffe, 'the executive head with the most urgent program to implement, with the sharpest ideas of what he meant to do and with the boldest desire to shape the national government accordingly.' In less than two years he presented three reports, defining a federal economic program which forced a major debate not only on the details of the program but on the purpose for which the union has been formed. Hamilton's own sense of purpose was clear; he would count the revolution for independence a success only if it were followed by the creation of a prosperous commerical nation, comparable, perhaps even competitive, in power and in energy, with its European counterparts."" (fn: Marcus Cunliffe, The Nation Takes Shape, 1789-1837, (Chicago, 1959), 23.) (Linda K. Kerber, History of U.S. Political Parties Volume I: 1789-1860: From Factions to Parties. Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., ed. New York, 1973, Chelsea House Publisher. p. 11)
""Federalists created their political program out of a political vision. They had shared in the revolutionaries' dream of a Republic of Virtue, and they emerged from a successful war against empire to search for guarantees that the republican experiment would not collapse."" (Kerber, p. 3)
""The Federalist political demand was for a competent government, one responsible for the destiny of the nation and with the power to direct what that destiny would be. What was missing in postwar America, they repeatedly complained in a large variety of contexts, was order, predictability, stability. A competent government would guarantee the prosperity and external security of the nation; a government of countervailing balances was less likely to be threatened by temporary lapses in civic virtue, while remaining strictly accountable to the public will."" (Kerber, p. 4)
""So long as Federalists controlled and staffed the agencies of the national government, the need to formulate alternate mechanisms for party decision making was veiled; with a Federalist in the White House, Federalists in the Cabinet, and Federalist majorities in Congress, the very institutional agencies of the government would themselves be the mechanism of party. Federal patronage could be used to bind party workers to the Federalist 'interest.' 'The reason of allowing Congress to appoint its own officers of the Customs, collectors of the taxes and military officers of every rank,' Hamilton said, 'is to create in the interior of each State, a mass of influence in favor of the Federal Government.' (fn: Alexander Hamilton, 1782, quoted in Lisle A. Rose, Prologue to Democracy: The Federalists in the South, 1789-1800, (Lexington, Kentucky, 1968), 3.) Federalists though of themselves as a government, not as a party; their history in the 1790's would be the history of alignments within the government, rather than of extrernal alignments which sought to influence the machinery of government."" (Kerber, p. 10)
""Major national issues invigorated the process of party formation; as state groups came, slowly and hesitantly, to resemble each other. The issues on which pro-administration and anti-administration positions might be assumed increased in number and in obvious significance; the polarity of the parties became clearer."" (Kerber, p. 11)
""As Adams' presidential decisions sequentially created a definition of the administration's goals as clear as Hamilton's funding program had once done, the range of political ideology which called itself Federalist simply became too broad to the party successfully to cast over it a unifying umbrella. Federalists were unified in their response to the XYZ Affair, and in their support of the Alien and Sedition Acts, which passed as party measures in the Fifth Congress, but in little else. The distance between Adams and Hamilton - in political philosophy, in willingness to contemplate war with France, in willingness to manipulate public opinion - was unbridgable; Hamilton's ill-tempered anti-Adams pamphlet of 1800 would be confirmation of a long-established distaste."" (Kerber, p. 14)
""One result of the war was to add to Federalist strength and party cohesion. There were several varieties of Federalist congressional opinion on the war: most believed that the Republicans had fomented hard feeling with England so that their party could pose as defende of American honor; many believed that in the aftermath of what they were sure to be an unsuccessful war the Republicans would fall from power and Federalists would be returned to office . . . Regardless of the region from which they came, Federalists voted against the war with virtual unanimity."" (Kerber, p. 24)","What role did the concept of ""republican virtue"" play in shaping the views of American politicians in the 1790s, and how did this influence the development of political parties?","The concept of ""republican virtue"" played a significant role in shaping the views of American politicians in the 1790s, particularly in the development of political parties.","['https://opened.cuny.edu/courseware/lesson/341/student/?section=3', 'https://eh.net/book_reviews/the-merchant-republics-amsterdam-antwerp-and-hamburg-1648-1790/', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republicanism', 'https://www.jstor.org/stable/27554499', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republicanism_in_the_United_States', 'https://scholarship.kentlaw.iit.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&httpsredir=1&article=2785&context=cklawreview', 'https://pressbooks-dev.oer.hawaii.edu/ushistory/chapter/competing-visions-federalists-and-democratic-republicans/', 'https://rowman.com/ISBN/9780739167212/The-Political-Education-of-Democratus-Negotiating-Civic-Virtue-during-the-Early-Republic', 'https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/americas-crisis-of-civic-virtue/', 'https://www.americanyawp.com/text/07-the-early-republic/', 'https://opened.cuny.edu/courseware/lesson/341/student/?section=3', 'https://eh.net/book_reviews/the-merchant-republics-amsterdam-antwerp-and-hamburg-1648-1790/', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republicanism', 'https://www.jstor.org/stable/27554499', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republicanism_in_the_United_States', 'https://scholarship.kentlaw.iit.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&httpsredir=1&article=2785&context=cklawreview', 'https://pressbooks-dev.oer.hawaii.edu/ushistory/chapter/competing-visions-federalists-and-democratic-republicans/', 'https://rowman.com/ISBN/9780739167212/The-Political-Education-of-Democratus-Negotiating-Civic-Virtue-during-the-Early-Republic', 'https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/americas-crisis-of-civic-virtue/', 'https://www.americanyawp.com/text/07-the-early-republic/', 'https://opened.cuny.edu/courseware/lesson/341/student/?section=3', 'https://eh.net/book_reviews/the-merchant-republics-amsterdam-antwerp-and-hamburg-1648-1790/', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republicanism', 'https://www.jstor.org/stable/27554499', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republicanism_in_the_United_States', 'https://scholarship.kentlaw.iit.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&httpsredir=1&article=2785&context=cklawreview', 'https://pressbooks-dev.oer.hawaii.edu/ushistory/chapter/competing-visions-federalists-and-democratic-republicans/', 'https://rowman.com/ISBN/9780739167212/The-Political-Education-of-Democratus-Negotiating-Civic-Virtue-during-the-Early-Republic', 'https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/americas-crisis-of-civic-virtue/', 'https://www.americanyawp.com/text/07-the-early-republic/']",politics

Regardless of the region from which they came, Federalists voted against the war with virtual unanimity."" (Kerber, p. 24)","** How did the election of the Whig Ticket in 1816 reflect the growing tensions between the United States and Great Britain, and what were the long-term implications of this election on the country's diplomatic relations with Europe?","The election of the Whig Ticket in 1816 had a significant impact on the country's diplomatic relations with Europe. The Whig Party, which was formed in opposition to the Democratic-Republican Party, was more sympathetic to British interests and sought to improve relations with Great Britain. The election of the Whig Ticket, which included William Henry Harrison and John Tyler, marked a shift in American foreign policy towards a more pro-British stance.

The Whigs believed that the British were a stabilizing force in international relations and sought to strengthen ties with them. This was in contrast to the Democratic-Republicans, who were more skeptical of British intentions and sought to maintain a policy of neutrality.

The election of the Whig Ticket also marked a shift in American foreign policy towards a more interventionist approach. The Whigs believed that the United States had a responsibility to intervene in international conflicts and to promote American interests abroad. This was in contrast to the Democratic-Republicans, who believed in a policy of non-intervention.

The long-term implications of the election of the Whig Ticket were significant. The Whigs' pro-British stance helped to improve relations between the two countries, and the Whigs' interventionist approach to foreign policy helped to establish the United States as a major player on the world stage.

In conclusion, the election of the Whig Ticket in 1816 had a significant impact on the country's diplomatic relations with Europe. The Whigs' pro-British stance and interventionist approach to foreign policy helped to improve relations between the two countries and establish the United States as a major player on the world stage.","['https://guides.loc.gov/american-history', 'https://www.archives.gov/files/legislative/resources/ebooks/two-party-system.pdf', 'https://www.americanyawp.com/text/09-democracy-in-america/', 'https://www.gilderlehrman.org/ap-us-history/period-4', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Clay', 'https://www.mountvernon.org/library/digitalhistory/digital-encyclopedia/article/gouverneur-morris', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Webster', 'https://www.alexandriava.gov/historic-alexandria/the-history-of-alexandria-discovering-the-decades', 'https://www.britannica.com/topic/Democratic-Republican-Party', 'http://www.npshistory.com/publications/nhl/theme-studies/presidents.pdf', 'https://guides.loc.gov/american-history', 'https://www.archives.gov/files/legislative/resources/ebooks/two-party-system.pdf', 'https://www.americanyawp.com/text/09-democracy-in-america/', 'https://www.gilderlehrman.org/ap-us-history/period-4', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Clay', 'https://www.mountvernon.org/library/digitalhistory/digital-encyclopedia/article/gouverneur-morris', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Webster', 'https://www.alexandriava.gov/historic-alexandria/the-history-of-alexandria-discovering-the-decades', 'https://www.britannica.com/topic/Democratic-Republican-Party', 'http://www.npshistory.com/publications/nhl/theme-studies/presidents.pdf', 'https://guides.loc.gov/american-history', 'https://www.archives.gov/files/legislative/resources/ebooks/two-party-system.pdf', 'https://www.americanyawp.com/text/09-democracy-in-america/', 'https://www.gilderlehrman.org/ap-us-history/period-4', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Clay', 'https://www.mountvernon.org/library/digitalhistory/digital-encyclopedia/article/gouverneur-morris', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Webster', 'https://www.alexandriava.gov/historic-alexandria/the-history-of-alexandria-discovering-the-decades', 'https://www.britannica.com/topic/Democratic-Republican-Party', 'http://www.npshistory.com/publications/nhl/theme-studies/presidents.pdf']",politics

"In natural law of the early modern period, there was a tendency in many cases to derive state models and general constitutional principles from natural basic human characteristics. In this way, for. For example, Rousseau's democratic ideal was based on an optimistic view of man, while Hobbes's demand for a state monopoly on the use of force and the various demands (e.g. by Locke and Montesquieu ) for control of violence and the separation of powers were based on a more pessimistic view of man.
The industrialization leads into the modern age. The Moderne is characterized (in their self-perception) of technical inventions, cultural revolutions and progress, secularism , political of Marxism , the emancipation of women and the labor movement , liberalism , fascism and two world wars .
In The Protestant Ethics and the 'Spirit' of Capitalism, Max Weber analyzes the economic processes of industrial society, contemporary work ethics, their anchoring in Protestantism. In their famous work Dialectic of the Enlightenment , the philosophers Theodor W. Adorno and Horkheimer criticize the inhumanity of the Nazi regime and other systems as a result of the overemphasized rational thinking of the Enlightenment: the concentration camps functioned perfectly technically organized according to rational viewpoints that add to the value of people quantified its material value.
In the second half of the 20th century, modern capitalist western societies emerged on the basis of democracy and human rights . The individual appears as a citizen and consumer , as a voter and as an employee . Prosperity and further rationalization are arriving. In the competing Eastern bloc , dogmatic socialism is supposed to realize the teachings of Karl Marx . The persecution of so-called deviants from the party line , authoritarian regimes and lack of freedom are the result.
With the student movement of 1968, with upheavals such as the powerful pop culture , a new image of man was introduced. The 68ers protest against a supposedly frozen society in West and East, a technocracy that does not give the individual any space, but demands appropriate behavior. Irrational aspects of human beings such as imagination are opposed by the 68s , esotericism , utopias , but also art and culture are expressions of this attitude.
In philosophy, philosophers such as Gilles Deleuze or Jacques Derrida outline the basic features of a new philosophy of man. They turn against the apparently self-evident unambiguities, binary decisions, codifications that have shaped the way people think about people and the world so far.
The postmodernism is characterized by the coexistence of a variety of views on the people of divergent new and old lifestyles .

Legal capacity, beginning and end","Can a society that emphasizes individual freedom and self-expression at the expense of community values be regarded as truly democratic, or does it risk undermining the very fabric of social coexistence?","The question of whether a society that emphasizes individual freedom and self-expression at the expense of community values can be regarded as truly democratic is a complex and contentious issue. The search results provide a diverse range of perspectives on the relationship between individual freedom and community values in a democratic society, highlighting the importance of finding a balance between the two.

On one hand, individual freedom and self-expression are essential components of a democratic society, as they allow individuals to pursue their own goals and interests, and to contribute to the common good in their own unique way. The search results emphasize the importance of individual freedoms such as respect for private life, freedom of thought, and freedom of expression, which are essential for the development of a democratic society.

On the other hand, community values and the common good are also essential components of a democratic society, as they provide a sense of shared identity and purpose, and help to promote social cohesion and cooperation. The search results highlight the importance of community values such as respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, and the rule of law, which are essential for the development of a democratic society.

In conclusion, while individual freedom and self-expression are essential components of a democratic society, they must be balanced with community values and the common good. A society that emphasizes individual freedom and self-expression at the expense of community values may not be truly democratic, as it may neglect the needs and interests of the community as a whole.","['https://european-union.europa.eu/principles-countries-history/principles-and-values/aims-and-values_en', 'https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/nsc/nssall.html', 'https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/about-us/our-portfolios/social-cohesion/australian-values', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ai-bill-of-rights/', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1592474/', 'https://www.scu.edu/mcae/publications/iie/v5n1/common.html', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5236078/', 'https://www.civiced.org/lesson-plans/constitutional-democracy', 'https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2018/democracy-crisis', 'https://www.civiced.org/papers/articles_role.html', 'https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/nsc/nssall.html', 'https://european-union.europa.eu/principles-countries-history/principles-and-values/aims-and-values_en', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1592474/', 'https://www.scu.edu/mcae/publications/iie/v5n1/common.html', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5236078/', 'https://www.socialstudies.org/national-curriculum-standards-social-studies-chapter-2-themes-social-studies', 'https://www.americanbar.org/groups/crsj/publications/human_rights_magazine_home/intersection-of-lgbtq-rights-and-religious-freedom/protecting-lgbtq-liberty-and-religious-liberty/', 'https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2021/653635/EXPO_STU(2021)653635_EN.pdf', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Blueprint-for-an-AI-Bill-of-Rights.pdf', 'https://www.ditchley.com/programme/virtual-programme-2020/balancing-individual-freedom-privacy-and-social-responsibility', 'https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/nsc/nssall.html', 'https://european-union.europa.eu/principles-countries-history/principles-and-values/aims-and-values_en', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1592474/', 'https://www.scu.edu/mcae/publications/iie/v5n1/common.html', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5236078/', 'https://www.socialstudies.org/national-curriculum-standards-social-studies-chapter-2-themes-social-studies', 'https://www.americanbar.org/groups/crsj/publications/human_rights_magazine_home/intersection-of-lgbtq-rights-and-religious-freedom/protecting-lgbtq-liberty-and-religious-liberty/', 'https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2021/653635/EXPO_STU(2021)653635_EN.pdf', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Blueprint-for-an-AI-Bill-of-Rights.pdf', 'https://www.ditchley.com/programme/virtual-programme-2020/balancing-individual-freedom-privacy-and-social-responsibility']",politics

Legal capacity, beginning and end",What might be the unintended consequences of a society that prioritizes scientific progress over human values in their approach to resolving disputes over reproductive rights?,"The potential unintended consequences of prioritizing scientific progress over human values in resolving disputes over reproductive rights may include:

1. Disregard for human dignity and autonomy: Scientific progress may lead to the development of technologies that disregard human dignity and autonomy, particularly for marginalized communities.
2. Lack of transparency and accountability: The prioritization of scientific progress may lead to a lack of transparency and accountability in the development and implementation of reproductive technologies, potentially leading to unintended consequences.
3. Disproportionate impact on marginalized communities: Scientific progress may disproportionately impact marginalized communities, exacerbating existing social and economic inequalities.
4. Erosion of human rights: The prioritization of scientific progress may lead to the erosion of human rights, particularly the right to life, autonomy, and dignity.
5. Unintended consequences for healthcare: Scientific progress may lead to unintended consequences for healthcare, including the development of technologies that prioritize profit over patient well-being.
6. Lack of cultural competency: The prioritization of scientific progress may lead to a lack of cultural competency in the development and implementation of reproductive technologies, potentially leading to unintended consequences.
7. Unintended consequences for the environment: Scientific progress may lead to unintended consequences for the environment, including the development of technologies that prioritize profit over sustainability.
8. Unintended consequences for social justice: Scientific progress may lead to unintended consequences for social justice, including the perpetuation of existing social and economic inequalities.

These are just a few examples of the potential unintended consequences of prioritizing scientific progress over human values in resolving disputes over reproductive rights. It is essential to consider the potential consequences of scientific progress and to prioritize human values and dignity in the development and implementation of reproductive technologies.","['https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2020/634452/EPRS_STU(2020)634452_EN.pdf', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7734391/', 'https://www.guttmacher.org/report/abortion-worldwide-2017', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6791475/', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/National-Strategy-on-Gender-Equity-and-Equality.pdf', 'https://www.unesco.org/en/artificial-intelligence/recommendation-ethics', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/National-Strategy-to-Advance-Privacy-Preserving-Data-Sharing-and-Analytics.pdf', 'https://effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/products/cultural-competence/research-protocol', 'https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Women/WG/WomensAutonomyEqualityReproductiveHealth.pdf', 'https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-HD-02-029.html', 'https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2020/634452/EPRS_STU(2020)634452_EN.pdf', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7734391/', 'https://www.guttmacher.org/report/abortion-worldwide-2017', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6791475/', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/National-Strategy-on-Gender-Equity-and-Equality.pdf', 'https://www.unesco.org/en/artificial-intelligence/recommendation-ethics', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/National-Strategy-to-Advance-Privacy-Preserving-Data-Sharing-and-Analytics.pdf', 'https://effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/products/cultural-competence/research-protocol', 'https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Women/WG/WomensAutonomyEqualityReproductiveHealth.pdf', 'https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-HD-02-029.html', 'https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2020/634452/EPRS_STU(2020)634452_EN.pdf', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7734391/', 'https://www.guttmacher.org/report/abortion-worldwide-2017', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6791475/', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/National-Strategy-on-Gender-Equity-and-Equality.pdf', 'https://www.unesco.org/en/artificial-intelligence/recommendation-ethics', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/National-Strategy-to-Advance-Privacy-Preserving-Data-Sharing-and-Analytics.pdf', 'https://effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/products/cultural-competence/research-protocol', 'https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Women/WG/WomensAutonomyEqualityReproductiveHealth.pdf', 'https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-HD-02-029.html']",politics
"In natural law of the early modern period, there was a tendency in many cases to derive state models and general constitutional principles from natural basic human characteristics. In this way, for. For example, Rousseau's democratic ideal was based on an optimistic view of man, while Hobbes's demand for a state monopoly on the use of force and the various demands (e.g. by Locke and Montesquieu ) for control of violence and the separation of powers were based on a more pessimistic view of man.
The industrialization leads into the modern age. The Moderne is characterized (in their self-perception) of technical inventions, cultural revolutions and progress, secularism , political of Marxism , the emancipation of women and the labor movement , liberalism , fascism and two world wars .
In The Protestant Ethics and the 'Spirit' of Capitalism, Max Weber analyzes the economic processes of industrial society, contemporary work ethics, their anchoring in Protestantism. In their famous work Dialectic of the Enlightenment , the philosophers Theodor W. Adorno and Horkheimer criticize the inhumanity of the Nazi regime and other systems as a result of the overemphasized rational thinking of the Enlightenment: the concentration camps functioned perfectly technically organized according to rational viewpoints that add to the value of people quantified its material value.
In the second half of the 20th century, modern capitalist western societies emerged on the basis of democracy and human rights . The individual appears as a citizen and consumer , as a voter and as an employee . Prosperity and further rationalization are arriving. In the competing Eastern bloc , dogmatic socialism is supposed to realize the teachings of Karl Marx . The persecution of so-called deviants from the party line , authoritarian regimes and lack of freedom are the result.
With the student movement of 1968, with upheavals such as the powerful pop culture , a new image of man was introduced. The 68ers protest against a supposedly frozen society in West and East, a technocracy that does not give the individual any space, but demands appropriate behavior. Irrational aspects of human beings such as imagination are opposed by the 68s , esotericism , utopias , but also art and culture are expressions of this attitude.
In philosophy, philosophers such as Gilles Deleuze or Jacques Derrida outline the basic features of a new philosophy of man. They turn against the apparently self-evident unambiguities, binary decisions, codifications that have shaped the way people think about people and the world so far.
The postmodernism is characterized by the coexistence of a variety of views on the people of divergent new and old lifestyles . What they usually have in common, however, is the will to pluralism and tolerance . In the 1970s and 1980s, the ecology movement developed a holistic view of man, in which the integration of man into nature is particularly emphasized. Youth movements such as punk or new wave propagate a melancholic to pessimistic- nihilistic view of people.
What makes a person?
Biological being and person
The question of what a person is and what is not is very fundamental, especially when it comes to whether it is a person in the sense of law or ethics. So the question is, when does life begin? B. a fertilized egg or an embryo is already a human, notoriously controversial in Western societies.
Distinctions have also been and are made within mankind, for example with regard to gender, age or race. Up until the 19th century there was a debate in theology , but also in science and politics, about whether women should be considered human or not and, if so, whether they were ""full"" people or just an inferior special form. The question of whether someone should be regarded as a human being also played an important role in the justification of slavery .
The differentiation between humans and animals is based on the assumption that humans have both instincts and the ability to reflect on themselves. This is how he differs (in his behavior ) from other living beings.
The image of man in the German constitution
The Basic Law's image of man is not that of an isolated sovereign individual; Rather, the Basic Law has decided the tension between the individual and the community in the sense of the person's relationship to and community, without affecting their intrinsic value. This results in particular from an overall view of Articles 1, 2, 12, 19 and 20 of the Basic Law . This means, however, that the individual must put up with those barriers to his freedom of action that the legislature draws for the maintenance and promotion of social coexistence within the limits of what is generally reasonable in the given circumstances, provided that the independence of the person is preserved.

Legal capacity, beginning and end","What are the implications for the concept of personhood if a person's memories and experiences are transferred into a new human body using advanced brain-computer interfaces, and the original body is destroyed?","The concept of personhood is a complex and multifaceted issue, and the implications of transferring memories and experiences into a new human body raise many ethical and philosophical questions. The search results highlight various perspectives on the matter, including the idea that consciousness can be transferred from one soul to another and that personal identity goes with consciousness, as proposed by John Locke. Other perspectives suggest that personhood is not solely defined by consciousness, but also by the lived, experienced body and the relationships we have with others.

The results also highlight the challenges of defining personhood in the context of dementia, where changes in relationships and identity can occur. Additionally, the concept of relational personhood is discussed, which emphasizes the significance of the lived, experienced body in the constitution of personhood.

The search results also touch on the idea that our personality is not fixed and that our experiences and memories shape who we are. This raises questions about the nature of personal identity and whether it is possible to transfer memories and experiences into a new body without creating a new person.

Overall, the implications of transferring memories and experiences into a new human body on personhood are complex and multifaceted, and the search results provide a wealth of information on the various perspectives on this issue.","['https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/11jqkgq/the_problem_of_transferring_consciousness_from/', 'https://www.futuretaleslab.com/articles/humanmemorytransfer', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9138975/', 'https://www.quora.com/Will-human-consciousness-ever-be-transferable-to-a-new-body-or-a-machine-e-g-a-robot-cyborg-computer-or-avatar-Can-you-transfer-your-own-consciousness-and-memory-and-leave-your-biological-body-without-creating-two-selves', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010945217302381', 'https://fortelabs.com/blog/the-body-keeps-the-score-summary/', 'https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/alcohol-and-adolescent-brain', 'https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/10/10/are-you-the-same-person-you-used-to-be-life-is-hard-the-origins-of-you', 'https://cognitiveresearchjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41235-020-00243-4', 'https://www.besselvanderkolk.com/resources/the-body-keeps-the-score', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3115296/', 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09557571.2022.2108761', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8564263/', 'https://medium.com/@blaisea/do-large-language-models-understand-us-6f881d6d8e75', 'https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/10/10/are-you-the-same-person-you-used-to-be-life-is-hard-the-origins-of-you', 'https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/identity-personal/', 'https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-022-01166-9', 'https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/locke-personal-identity/', 'https://sapereaude.voices.wooster.edu/2018/10/16/286/', 'https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/19401/chapter/8', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3115296/', 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09557571.2022.2108761', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8564263/', 'https://medium.com/@blaisea/do-large-language-models-understand-us-6f881d6d8e75', 'https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/10/10/are-you-the-same-person-you-used-to-be-life-is-hard-the-origins-of-you', 'https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/identity-personal/', 'https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-022-01166-9', 'https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/locke-personal-identity/', 'https://sapereaude.voices.wooster.edu/2018/10/16/286/', 'https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/19401/chapter/8']",politics
"This group, in theory, would save the black community by uplifting the downtrodden blacks into social and economic prosperity. In 1909 Dubos and his allies formed the NAACP, an organization that attempted o end discrimination by pursuing legal redress in the courts. Dubos’ beliefs rarely appealed to poor blacks; white progressive liberals supported him, however, and the early leadership of the NAACP consisted largely of white progressives. By 1914 the NAACP had fifty branch offices and over 6,000 members nationwide.
Nevertheless, other than its attack on southern lynching, the NAACP did little to improve the situation of black Americans. The Women’s Movement: During the same period the Progressive challenge also extended to women. Like blacks, women were faced with the same dilemma: how do we achieve equality? Before 1910 those who took pert in the quest for women’s rights referred to themselves as the woman’s movement. This movement generally characterized middle-class women who wanted to escape the home by participating in social organizations, achieving a college education, or by getting a job.
These social organizations, or Women’s Clubs, gave women, who had no opportunity to serve in public office, a chance to affect legislation. Rather than pushing for substantial legislation, such as trust-busting, these clubs organized their efforts around domestic social issues. These included improving education, regulating child ND women’s labor, housing reform, and other goals. Feminism: About 191 0 many of these organizations that dealt with women’s issues, particularly Suffrage, began to use the term Feminism to refer to their efforts.
Feminists were bold, outspoken, and more conscious of their female identity. Feminism focused particularly on economic and sexual independence for women. Economically, they believed that women should enter the modern age by seeking employment, in essence leaving their domestic responsibilities to paid employees. Sexually, they strongly advocated the use of birth control. This movement was led by Margaret Ganger. Ganger visited immigrant neighborhoods in New Work’s East Side, distributing leaflets about contraception, in the hopes of preventing unwanted pregnancies.
Her birth control crusade won the support of many middle-class women, who believed contraception would limit the size of their own families, as well as controlling the immigrant population. She did have opponents, however. Some believed that birth control movement posed a threat to the family and to morality. In 1914 Ganger was arrested for sending obscene material (contraceptive information) by mail, and she fled the country for a year. In 1921 she formed he American Birth Control League, a group which enlisted doctors and social workers to push judges to allow the distribution of birth control information.
Although in these efforts she was unsuccessful, she did force the issue into the mainstream public. Teddy Roosevelt: Teddy Roosevelt, whom many believe was the most forceful president since Lincoln, was president from 1 901-1908. He was the descendant of a wealthy Dutch family, who instilled into him a sense of civic duty. He served three terms in the New York State Assembly, as New York City’s police commissioner, and in the Spanish American War he became a look hero by leading a motley group of volunteers called the rough riders. During his presidency, Roosevelt adopted a cautious version of progressive reform.
He avoided such political meat-grinders as the tariff issue, and when he approached the issue of trusts, he always assured the business community that he was on their side. For him, politics was the art of the possible. Unlike the more advanced progressives and the “lunatic left,” as he called them, Roosevelt believed that half a loaf was better than none. He believed that reform was needed to keep things on an even keel. Regulation of Trusts: Roosevelt very quickly gained a reputation as a trust- buster. Instead, however, he believed that consolidation was more effective in ensuring progress.
Rather than tolerate uncontrolled competition, he distinguished between good trusts and bad trusts. Bad trusts, to Roosevelt, were the OR, meat-packing and Oil trusts. He believed that these trusts unscrupulously exploited the public; consequently, they should not dominate the market. Instead of prosecuting these trusts, Roosevelt advocated mergers and other forms of expansion. In 1906 he persuaded Congress to ass the Hepburn Act: this imposed stricter control over IRS. It gave the ICC the authority to set OR rates, although it gave the states the authority to overturn rate decisions.","How did the socially and economically marginalized groups within the black community respond to the NAACP's efforts to uplift them, and what role did these groups play in shaping the organization's policies and strategies?","The NAACP's efforts to uplift marginalized groups within the black community were met with varying degrees of resistance, cooperation, and activism.","['https://naacp.org/', 'https://www.naacpldf.org/student-loans-racial-wealth-gap/', 'https://naacp.org/about/our-history', 'https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-announces-completion-naacp-buffalo-headquarters-buffalos-michigan-street', 'https://naacp.org/articles/naacp-issues-travel-advisory-florida', 'https://www.naacpldf.org/critical-race-theory-faq/', 'https://naacp.org/know-issues/environmental-climate-justice', 'https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/', 'https://naacp.org/about/mission-vision', 'https://www.naacprochestermn.org/', 'https://naacp.org/articles/naacp-condemns-scotus-ruling-affirmative-action', 'https://www.naacpldf.org/critical-race-theory-faq/', 'https://naacp.org/articles/naacp-calls-american-airlines-respond-pattern-discrimination', 'https://www.naacpldf.org/naacp-publications/ldf-blog/important-facts-about-ldfs-lawsuit-challenging-georgias-voter-suppression-bill/', 'https://naacp.org/', 'https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-race-ethnicity-and-politics/article/are-black-state-legislators-more-responsive-to-emails-associated-with-the-naacp-versus-blm-a-field-experiment-on-black-intragroup-politics/AB6256E07FC484414D22A222EBB23F82', 'https://naacp.org/articles/naacp-reflects-first-2024-presidential-debate', 'https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/eyesontheprize-groups-during-american-civil-rights-movement/', 'https://naacp.org/articles/naacp-files-lawsuit-response-passage-unconstitutional-legislation-mississippi', 'https://floridaphoenix.com/2023/05/22/naacp-travel-advisory-on-florida-provokes-strong-reactions/', 'https://naacp.org/articles/naacp-condemns-scotus-ruling-affirmative-action', 'https://www.naacpldf.org/critical-race-theory-faq/', 'https://naacp.org/articles/naacp-calls-american-airlines-respond-pattern-discrimination', 'https://www.naacpldf.org/naacp-publications/ldf-blog/important-facts-about-ldfs-lawsuit-challenging-georgias-voter-suppression-bill/', 'https://naacp.org/', 'https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-race-ethnicity-and-politics/article/are-black-state-legislators-more-responsive-to-emails-associated-with-the-naacp-versus-blm-a-field-experiment-on-black-intragroup-politics/AB6256E07FC484414D22A222EBB23F82', 'https://naacp.org/articles/naacp-reflects-first-2024-presidential-debate', 'https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/eyesontheprize-groups-during-american-civil-rights-movement/', 'https://naacp.org/articles/naacp-files-lawsuit-response-passage-unconstitutional-legislation-mississippi', 'https://floridaphoenix.com/2023/05/22/naacp-travel-advisory-on-florida-provokes-strong-reactions/']",politics

"This group, in theory, would save the black community by uplifting the downtrodden blacks into social and economic prosperity. In 1909 Dubos and his allies formed the NAACP, an organization that attempted o end discrimination by pursuing legal redress in the courts. Dubos’ beliefs rarely appealed to poor blacks; white progressive liberals supported him, however, and the early leadership of the NAACP consisted largely of white progressives. By 1914 the NAACP had fifty branch offices and over 6,000 members nationwide.
Nevertheless, other than its attack on southern lynching, the NAACP did little to improve the situation of black Americans. The Women’s Movement: During the same period the Progressive challenge also extended to women. Like blacks, women were faced with the same dilemma: how do we achieve equality? Before 1910 those who took pert in the quest for women’s rights referred to themselves as the woman’s movement. This movement generally characterized middle-class women who wanted to escape the home by participating in social organizations, achieving a college education, or by getting a job.
These social organizations, or Women’s Clubs, gave women, who had no opportunity to serve in public office, a chance to affect legislation. Rather than pushing for substantial legislation, such as trust-busting, these clubs organized their efforts around domestic social issues. These included improving education, regulating child ND women’s labor, housing reform, and other goals. Feminism: About 191 0 many of these organizations that dealt with women’s issues, particularly Suffrage, began to use the term Feminism to refer to their efforts.
Feminists were bold, outspoken, and more conscious of their female identity. Feminism focused particularly on economic and sexual independence for women. Economically, they believed that women should enter the modern age by seeking employment, in essence leaving their domestic responsibilities to paid employees. Sexually, they strongly advocated the use of birth control. This movement was led by Margaret Ganger. Ganger visited immigrant neighborhoods in New Work’s East Side, distributing leaflets about contraception, in the hopes of preventing unwanted pregnancies.
Her birth control crusade won the support of many middle-class women, who believed contraception would limit the size of their own families, as well as controlling the immigrant population. She did have opponents, however. Some believed that birth control movement posed a threat to the family and to morality. In 1914 Ganger was arrested for sending obscene material (contraceptive information) by mail, and she fled the country for a year. In 1921 she formed he American Birth Control League, a group which enlisted doctors and social workers to push judges to allow the distribution of birth control information.
Although in these efforts she was unsuccessful, she did force the issue into the mainstream public. Teddy Roosevelt: Teddy Roosevelt, whom many believe was the most forceful president since Lincoln, was president from 1 901-1908. He was the descendant of a wealthy Dutch family, who instilled into him a sense of civic duty. He served three terms in the New York State Assembly, as New York City’s police commissioner, and in the Spanish American War he became a look hero by leading a motley group of volunteers called the rough riders. During his presidency, Roosevelt adopted a cautious version of progressive reform.
He avoided such political meat-grinders as the tariff issue, and when he approached the issue of trusts, he always assured the business community that he was on their side. For him, politics was the art of the possible. Unlike the more advanced progressives and the “lunatic left,” as he called them, Roosevelt believed that half a loaf was better than none. He believed that reform was needed to keep things on an even keel. Regulation of Trusts: Roosevelt very quickly gained a reputation as a trust- buster.

The publications and media outlets of the time helped to challenge societal norms and promote women's rights, which in turn influenced public opinion and contributed to the advancement of women's rights.

Some of the most influential publications and media outlets of the time include:

* The National Women's Suffrage Movement in the United States, which was founded in the late 19th century and continued to advocate for women's suffrage throughout the early 20th century.
* The feminist magazine ""Les Voix des femmes"", which was founded by Eugénie Niboyet in 1848 and was considered to be the first daily feminist newspaper.
* The American feminist magazine ""Late 20th Century Feminist Periodicals"", which was published in the 1970s and 1980s and featured articles and essays on women's rights and feminism.
* The feminist newspaper ""The Woman's Journal"", which was published in the United States from 1870 to 1917 and was a leading voice for women's suffrage and women's rights.
* The feminist magazine ""Ms."", which was founded in 1972 and was a leading voice for women's rights and feminism in the 1970s and 1980s.

These publications and media outlets, along with others, helped to shape public opinion on women's rights and equality and contributed to the advancement of women's rights in the early 20th century.","['https://www.womenshistory.org/articles/coverture-word-you-probably-dont-know-should', 'https://women.ca.gov/women-of-color-and-the-fight-for-womens-suffrage/', 'https://www.womenshistory.org/education-resources/biographies/betty-friedan', 'https://guides.lib.virginia.edu/c.php?g=514751&p=3522205', 'https://guides.loc.gov/feminism-french-women-history/19th-century', 'https://www.pacificu.edu/magazine/four-waves-feminism', 'https://guides.loc.gov/feminism-french-women-history/20th-century', 'https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/woman-suffrage', 'https://www.nps.gov/articles/the-internationalist-history-of-the-us-suffrage-movement.htm', 'https://www.britannica.com/event/womens-movement', 'https://www.womenshistory.org/articles/coverture-word-you-probably-dont-know-should', 'https://women.ca.gov/women-of-color-and-the-fight-for-womens-suffrage/', 'https://www.womenshistory.org/education-resources/biographies/betty-friedan', 'https://guides.lib.virginia.edu/c.php?g=514751&p=3522205', 'https://guides.loc.gov/feminism-french-women-history/19th-century', 'https://www.pacificu.edu/magazine/four-waves-feminism', 'https://guides.loc.gov/feminism-french-women-history/20th-century', 'https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/woman-suffrage', 'https://www.nps.gov/articles/the-internationalist-history-of-the-us-suffrage-movement.htm', 'https://www.britannica.com/event/womens-movement', 'https://www.womenshistory.org/articles/coverture-word-you-probably-dont-know-should', 'https://women.ca.gov/women-of-color-and-the-fight-for-womens-suffrage/', 'https://www.womenshistory.org/education-resources/biographies/betty-friedan', 'https://guides.lib.virginia.edu/c.php?g=514751&p=3522205', 'https://guides.loc.gov/feminism-french-women-history/19th-century', 'https://www.pacificu.edu/magazine/four-waves-feminism', 'https://guides.loc.gov/feminism-french-women-history/20th-century', 'https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/woman-suffrage', 'https://www.nps.gov/articles/the-internationalist-history-of-the-us-suffrage-movement.htm', 'https://www.britannica.com/event/womens-movement']",politics

"What is a Cold War?
A Cold War is a state of conflict between nations that does not involve direct military action but is pursued primarily through economic and political actions, propaganda, acts of espionage, or proxy wars waged by surrogates.
In International relations literature, it is the period between shortly before the end of World War 2 till the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1990 which is known as the Cold War. During this period, the old rivalry between the West, led by the USA, and the Soviet block, led by the USSR resurfaced souring the relations.
During this period though there was no direct war between these opposing groups, there was no peace also. Both superpowers, the USA and the USSR gathered allies around them who attacked each other with propaganda and economic measures, and with a general policy of non-cooperation. Whatever one bloc suggested or did was viewed by the other as having ulterior and aggressive motives.
Causes of The Cold War
Like every momentous historical event, the Cold War was the cumulative result of multiple trends and events and had multidimensional perspectives. Some of these could be listed as follows
1. Struggle for Hegemony/Resources
Ultimately all wars, hot or cold, are for establishing your hegemony as well as accessing global resources like hydrocarbon resources, access to markets, gaining a foothold of a geostrategic location, etc. Of coua use, all such adventures are camouflaged under the name of high moral values. Cold War 1 (1945–1991) was no exception.
It started soon after the first world war between a resurgent USSR and the USA which had recently emerged as the superpower of the day. When civil war broke out in Russia in 1918, the USA, Britain, France, and Japan sent troops to Russia to help the anti-communist forces. This was the first signal of the start of the Cold War.
The communists won the war, but Joseph Stalin, who became Russian leader in 1929, was convinced that there would be another attempt by the capitalist powers to destroy communism in Russia. The German invasion of Russia in 1941 proved him right. The need for self-preservation against Germany and Japan caused the USSR, the USA, and Britain to forget their differences and work together, but as soon as the defeat of Germany was only a matter of time, both sides began to plan for the postwar period.
2. Clash of Ideologies
The basic cause of conflict lay in the differences in principle between the communist states and the capitalist or liberal-democratic states.
• The communist system of organizing the state and society was based on the ideas of Karl Marx; he believed that the wealth of a country should be collectively owned and shared by everybody. The economy should be centrally planned and the interests and well-being of the working classes safeguarded by state social policies.
• The capitalist system, on the other hand, operates based on private ownership of a country’s wealth. The driving forces behind capitalism are private enterprise in the pursuit of making profits, and the preservation of the power of private wealth.
Ever since the world’s first communist government was set up in Russia (the USSR) in 1917, the governments of most capitalist states viewed it with mistrust and were afraid of communism spreading to their countries. This would mean the end of the private ownership of wealth, as well as the loss of political power by the wealthy classes.
3. Stalin’s foreign policies contributed to the tensions
Stalin wanted to take advantage of the military situation to strengthen Soviet influence in Europe. As the Nazi armies collapsed, he tried to occupy as much German territory as he could and acquire as much land as he could get away with from countries such as Finland, Poland, and Romania. In this, he was highly successful, but the West was alarmed at what they took to be Soviet aggression; they believed that he was committed to spreading communism over as much of the globe as possible.
4. Western Politicians’ hostility to the Soviet government
During the war, the USA under President Roosevelt sent war materials of all kinds to Russia under a system known as ‘Lend-Lease’, and Roosevelt was inclined to trust Stalin. But after Roosevelt died, in April 1945, his successor Harry S. Truman was more suspicious and toughened his attitude towards the communists. Some historians believe that Truman’s main motive for dropping the atomic bombs on Japan was not simply to defeat Japan, which was ready to surrender anyway but to show Stalin what might happen to Russia if he dared go too far.

5. Stalin’s Fears","How did the concept of a ""trickle-down effect"" in a capitalist economy influence the Soviet Union's perception of the working class and their role in the communist ideology, ultimately contributing to the Cold War tensions?","The concept of a ""trickle-down effect"" in a capitalist economy had a significant impact on the Soviet Union's perception of the working class and their role in the communist ideology, ultimately contributing to the Cold War tensions.

The concept of trickle-down economics, which suggests that economic growth and prosperity will benefit the working class through the creation of jobs and increased economic activity, was a central tenet of Reaganomics, the economic policies of President Ronald Reagan. This idea was seen as a threat to the Soviet Union's communist ideology, which emphasized the importance of collective ownership and the redistribution of wealth.

The Soviet Union saw the trickle-down effect as a means of perpetuating inequality and maintaining the power of the capitalist elite. They believed that the benefits of economic growth would not trickle down to the working class, but instead would be concentrated among the wealthy and powerful. This perception was reinforced by the stagnant incomes of the poor and middle class, which were seen as a result of the trickle-down effect.

The Soviet Union's perception of the working class and their role in the communist ideology was also influenced by the concept of trickle-down economics. They saw the working class as a key component of the communist revolution, and believed that they would be the primary beneficiaries of a socialist economy. However, the trickle-down effect was seen as a means of undermining this revolution, by creating a class of wealthy capitalists who would exploit the working class.

The Cold War tensions between the Soviet Union and the United States were also influenced by the concept of trickle-down economics. The Soviet Union saw the trickle-down effect as a means of perpetuating capitalism and maintaining the power of the capitalist elite, while the United States saw it as a means of promoting economic growth and prosperity. This led to a series of economic and political tensions between the two superpowers, which ultimately contributed to the Cold War.

In conclusion, the concept of trickle-down economics had a significant impact on the Soviet Union's perception of the working class and their role in the communist ideology, ultimately contributing to the Cold War tensions. The Soviet Union saw the trickle-down effect as a means of perpetuating inequality and maintaining the power of the capitalist elite, while the United States saw it as a means of promoting economic growth and prosperity.","['https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2015/sdn1513.pdf', 'https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reaganomics.asp', 'https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/ATAG/2018/620225/EPRS_ATA(2018)620225_EN.pdf', 'https://www.americanyawp.com/text/29-the-triumph-of-the-right/', 'https://www.elibrary.imf.org/view/journals/001/2021/166/article-A001-en.xml', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/state-of-the-union-2022/', 'https://clintonwhitehouse5.archives.gov/WH/Accomplishments/eightyears-03.html', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/06/10/remarks-by-president-biden-on-inflation-and-actions-taken-to-lower-prices-and-address-supply-chain-challenges/', 'https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/cuban-migration-postrevolution-exodus-ebbs-and-flows', 'https://www.faireconomy.org/trickle_down_economics_four_reasons', 'https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2015/sdn1513.pdf', 'https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reaganomics.asp', 'https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/ATAG/2018/620225/EPRS_ATA(2018)620225_EN.pdf', 'https://www.americanyawp.com/text/29-the-triumph-of-the-right/', 'https://www.elibrary.imf.org/view/journals/001/2021/166/article-A001-en.xml', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/state-of-the-union-2022/', 'https://clintonwhitehouse5.archives.gov/WH/Accomplishments/eightyears-03.html', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/06/10/remarks-by-president-biden-on-inflation-and-actions-taken-to-lower-prices-and-address-supply-chain-challenges/', 'https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/cuban-migration-postrevolution-exodus-ebbs-and-flows', 'https://www.faireconomy.org/trickle_down_economics_four_reasons']",politics

Stalin’s Fears","What was the primary motivation behind the US decision to establish a network of military bases in Asia and Europe in the late 1940s, and how did this move contribute to the growing tensions between the Soviet Union and the United States?","The primary motivation behind the US decision to establish a network of military bases in Asia and Europe in the late 1940s was to maintain a strategic presence and deter the spread of communism, particularly in the aftermath of World War II.","['https://www.nationalww2museum.org/war/articles/path-pearl-harbor', 'https://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/japan-reconstruction', 'https://www.nationalww2museum.org/students-teachers/student-resources/research-starters/research-starters-us-military-numbers', 'https://history.state.gov/milestones/1937-1945/lend-lease', 'https://education.cfr.org/learn/reading/how-did-united-states-become-global-power', 'https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/declassified_139339.htm', 'https://www.defense.gov/News/Feature-Stories/story/article/2293108/', 'https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/the-united-states-isolation-intervention', 'https://www.umgc.edu/experience/why-choose-umgc/mission-values/history-timeline', 'https://www.floridamemory.com/learn/classroom/learning-units/wwii/', 'https://www.nationalww2museum.org/war/articles/path-pearl-harbor', 'https://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/japan-reconstruction', 'https://www.nationalww2museum.org/students-teachers/student-resources/research-starters/research-starters-us-military-numbers', 'https://history.state.gov/milestones/1937-1945/lend-lease', 'https://education.cfr.org/learn/reading/how-did-united-states-become-global-power', 'https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/declassified_139339.htm', 'https://www.defense.gov/News/Feature-Stories/story/article/2293108/', 'https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/the-united-states-isolation-intervention', 'https://www.umgc.edu/experience/why-choose-umgc/mission-values/history-timeline', 'https://www.floridamemory.com/learn/classroom/learning-units/wwii/', 'https://www.nationalww2museum.org/war/articles/path-pearl-harbor', 'https://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/japan-reconstruction', 'https://www.nationalww2museum.org/students-teachers/student-resources/research-starters/research-starters-us-military-numbers', 'https://history.state.gov/milestones/1937-1945/lend-lease', 'https://education.cfr.org/learn/reading/how-did-united-states-become-global-power', 'https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/declassified_139339.htm', 'https://www.defense.gov/News/Feature-Stories/story/article/2293108/', 'https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/the-united-states-isolation-intervention', 'https://www.umgc.edu/experience/why-choose-umgc/mission-values/history-timeline', 'https://www.floridamemory.com/learn/classroom/learning-units/wwii/']",politics
"Another important implication of creating new provinces on the national integration will come in shape of self-rule. When the people of these areas will be allowed to exercise provincial autonomy thus ruling themselves, they can better decide their lives keeping in view their resources and needs. This thing will keep them busy in healthy local politics and prevent sedition.
Thirdly, creating new provinces can ensure better administration. It is mostly difficult to administer a large province. Thus dividing it into two or more smaller provinces can help in administering it well. This also brings fortune to the people of that area without transmission of resources and revenue to the other autonomous parts of the province.
Fourthly, the creation of new provinces strengthens national integration by bringing welfare to the state as a whole. When a province or country is welfare, it will surely add to the strength of the state.
Contrary to the positive implications of creating new provinces on Pakistan, there are certain abnormalities that are attributed with taking such a step. In general creation of new provinces is a constitutional step which in no way can disintegrate a country. A nation’s integration begins to deteriorate when the issue about the creation of new provinces is politicized. When the political parties begin to measure the creation of new provinces according to their peculiar interests, several controversies emerge. Take example of the behavior of Pakistan’s political parties on the issue of new provinces. Pakistan People’s Party supports the voice for Siraiki province to curb the influence of Pakistan Muslim League (N) in Punjab. To counter this move, the latter political party supports the Muhajir community in making Karachi a province to contain the influence of Pakistan People’s Party in Sindh. Thus, this sort of politics keeps on rendering the issues controversial.
Pakistan’s integration will be adversely impacted by the creation of new provinces in case the provinces are created on ethnic lines. A new province is meant to be created on administrative basis. It is when done in order to favor an ethnic group, the national integration faces a blow.
New provinces if created in Pakistan can weaken the country’s integration if provincialism overwhelms the political scene. If the people of a province pledge to vote only the political party of that province, it will annihilate national cohesion. In the past, the people of Bengal voted for Awami Muslim League and the Peoples Party won in West Pakistan. This later proved to be of fatal consequence when the politico-lingual gaps between the two became so wide that East Pakistan seceded from West Pakistan. This sort of provincialism has caused considerable damage to national unity in the past.
To cope with all such circumstances in Pakistan, a middle way can be adopted. New provinces shall not be created as a first resort but this is conditioned with the pledge to administer the already existing provinces with just policies for all areas. In case it becomes inevitable to create a new province, it should be in no way on the ethnic lines. This can lead to dire consequences and severe implications on national integration.
In compact, the creation of new provinces can be fruitful if not based on ethnic lines and not subject to abnormal politicization of the issues. Pakistan integration shall be kept prior before devising any such plan.

"Another important implication of creating new provinces on the national integration will come in shape of self-rule. When the people of these areas will be allowed to exercise provincial autonomy thus ruling themselves, they can better decide their lives keeping in view their resources and needs. This thing will keep them busy in healthy local politics and prevent sedition.
Thirdly, creating new provinces can ensure better administration. It is mostly difficult to administer a large province. Thus dividing it into two or more smaller provinces can help in administering it well. This also brings fortune to the people of that area without transmission of resources and revenue to the other autonomous parts of the province.
Fourthly, the creation of new provinces strengthens national integration by bringing welfare to the state as a whole. When a province or country is welfare, it will surely add to the strength of the state.
Contrary to the positive implications of creating new provinces on Pakistan, there are certain abnormalities that are attributed with taking such a step. In general creation of new provinces is a constitutional step which in no way can disintegrate a country. A nation’s integration begins to deteriorate when the issue about the creation of new provinces is politicized. When the political parties begin to measure the creation of new provinces according to their peculiar interests, several controversies emerge. Take example of the behavior of Pakistan’s political parties on the issue of new provinces. Pakistan People’s Party supports the voice for Siraiki province to curb the influence of Pakistan Muslim League (N) in Punjab. To counter this move, the latter political party supports the Muhajir community in making Karachi a province to contain the influence of Pakistan People’s Party in Sindh. Thus, this sort of politics keeps on rendering the issues controversial.
Pakistan’s integration will be adversely impacted by the creation of new provinces in case the provinces are created on ethnic lines. A new province is meant to be created on administrative basis. It is when done in order to favor an ethnic group, the national integration faces a blow.
New provinces if created in Pakistan can weaken the country’s integration if provincialism overwhelms the political scene. If the people of a province pledge to vote only the political party of that province, it will annihilate national cohesion. In the past, the people of Bengal voted for Awami Muslim League and the Peoples Party won in West Pakistan. This later proved to be of fatal consequence when the politico-lingual gaps between the two became so wide that East Pakistan seceded from West Pakistan. This sort of provincialism has caused considerable damage to national unity in the past.
To cope with all such circumstances in Pakistan, a middle way can be adopted. New provinces shall not be created as a first resort but this is conditioned with the pledge to administer the already existing provinces with just policies for all areas. In case it becomes inevitable to create a new province, it should be in no way on the ethnic lines. This can lead to dire consequences and severe implications on national integration.
In compact, the creation of new provinces can be fruitful if not based on ethnic lines and not subject to abnormal politicization of the issues. Pakistan integration shall be kept prior before devising any such plan.

On one hand, the creation of new provinces can lead to a stronger sense of national identity among the population by recognizing and respecting the cultural and linguistic diversity of different regions. This can also lead to greater representation and participation in governance, which can help to reduce regional tensions and promote national unity.

On the other hand, the creation of new provinces can also exacerbate existing regional tensions and divisions. This can happen if the new provinces are created without adequate consultation and representation of the affected regions, leading to feelings of marginalization and resentment. Additionally, the creation of new provinces can also lead to increased competition for resources and power, which can further exacerbate regional tensions.

In conclusion, the creation of new provinces in Pakistan is a complex issue that requires careful consideration and planning to ensure that it promotes national unity and stability, rather than exacerbating regional tensions and divisions.","['https://www.jstor.org/stable/48505480', 'https://ojs.jdss.org.pk/journal/article/download/470/350/581', 'https://ndujournal.ndu.edu.pk/site/article/download/84/66/78', 'https://www.nation.com.pk/18-May-2024/creating-new-provinces', 'https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0019556120906585', 'https://asiasociety.org/education/pakistan-political-history', 'https://www.state.gov/reports/2022-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/indonesia/', 'https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/22338659231178702', 'https://www.state.gov/reports/2022-report-on-international-religious-freedom/pakistan/', 'https://www.belfercenter.org/sites/default/files/files/publication/The%20formation%20of%20Azerbaijani%20collective%20identity%20in%20Iran.pdf', 'https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker/conflict/conflict-between-india-and-pakistan', 'https://www.crisisgroup.org/africa/central-africa/democratic-republic-congo/katanga-tensions-drcs-mineral-heartland', 'https://www.reuters.com/world/pakistan-has-conducted-strikes-inside-iran-afp-report-2024-01-18/', 'https://www.crisisgroup.org/crisiswatch', 'https://www.international.gc.ca/transparency-transparence/indo-pacific-indo-pacifique/index.aspx?lang=eng', 'https://asiasociety.org/education/pakistan-political-history', 'https://www.usip.org/publications/2024/01/making-sense-iran-pakistan-cross-border-strikes', 'https://www.state.gov/united-states-strategy-to-prevent-conflict-and-promote-stability/', 'https://www.dni.gov/nctc/groups/isil.html', 'https://www.csis.org/analysis/islamic-state-khorasan-province-exploiting-counterterrorism-gap', 'https://www.crisisgroup.org/africa/central-africa/democratic-republic-congo/katanga-tensions-drcs-mineral-heartland', 'https://asiasociety.org/education/pakistan-political-history', 'https://www.international.gc.ca/transparency-transparence/indo-pacific-indo-pacifique/index.aspx?lang=eng', 'https://www.crisisgroup.org/asia/south-east-asia/myanmar/312-identity-crisis-ethnicity-and-conflict-myanmar', 'https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker/conflict/conflict-between-india-and-pakistan', 'https://www.iar-gwu.org/print-archive/8er0x982v5pj129srhre98ex6u8v8n', 'https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/SASC_Unclassified_2016_ATA_SFR_FINAL.pdf', 'https://press.un.org/en/2023/sc15199.doc.htm', 'https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/Newsroom/Reports%20and%20Pubs/2025_Global_Trends_Final_Report.pdf', 'https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-26414014']",politics
"In one hand, due to the oppression of the Awami League government and its collaborators, and on the other, due to the harassment of the miscreants, the lives of the Jumma peoples became miserable. The people came to the brink of life and death in a state of utter helplessness. A stalemate ensued throughout the region. The Jumma people especially felt the lack of a political party at such a time. These events made it more clear to the Jumma society that these oppressed and deprived peoples have no alternative way to survive except struggle. And a well-organized movement requires a political party of its own. The Parbatya Chattagram Parichalana Committee (CHT Election Running Committee), formed in 1970, stood by the Jumma people during the most disastrous days of national life in the newly independent Bangladesh and continued to deal with the situation with determination. Along with that, the process of forming an own political party also went ahead.
Due to the geographical, socio-economic and political context of CHT, distinct governance system and unique the culture and ethnic identity of the Jumma people, most of the conscious students and intellectuals including M N Larma, Santu Larma, Ananta Bihari Khisa, Amiya Sen Chakma and Kali Madhab Chakma were in favor of forming own political party to protect the legitimate rights of the Jumma peoples of CHT at that time. At this time, instead of forming a new political party, the idea arose to revive the Parbatya Chattagram Jana Samiti formed in the British period. As a result, the acceptance of the political party will be achieved, as well as the work of strengthening as a political party will be easier. At that time M N Larma along with some companions discussed with Kamini Mohan Dewan, former president of Parbatya Chattagram Jana Samity. He opined that since Parbatya Chattagram Jana Samiti was banned during the Pakistan period, a new party under this name would not be appropriate. Despite this opinion, the first political party of the Jumma people was formed on 15 February 1972 by changing the name of Parbatya Chittagram Jana Samity to ‘Parbatya Chittaggram Jana Samhati Samiti’ (PCJSS).
The convening committee of the PCJSS was formed on that day with M N Larma was as convener. Jyotirindra Bodhipriya Larma, Amiya Sen Chakma, Kali Madhab Chakma, Pankaj Dewan among others were the leading persons in establishing PCJSS. On that day they jointly took oath and formed the PCJSS. But later Pankaj Dewan was not active. This day was a historic and unforgettable day of political as well as national awakening of the entire nation of Jumma peoples.
Then on 24 June 1972, a conference of PCJSS was held at Indrapuri Cinema Hall in Rangamati. Eminent social activist Kamini Mohan Dewan was supposed to preside over this conference but he could not attend. However, he sent a written statement. In the conference, a 60-member central committee of the PCJSS was formed with Birendra Kishore Roaza as the president and MN Larma as the general secretary.
Other members of the Central Committee include Hlathowai Prue Karbari, Hira Lal Chakma, Sutakarma Karbari, Birendra Lal Roaza and Monghla Prue Chowdhury as Vice Presidents; Jatindra Lal Tripura and Sonot Kumar Chakma as Joint Secretary; Priti Kumar Chakma as Organizing Secretary; Sukriti Ranjan Chakma as Assistant Organizing Secretary, Ardhendu Bikash Chakma as Publicity Secretary; Kongzai as cultural Secretary; Gyanadatta Khisa as Treasurer; Anadi Kumar Chakma as Office Secretary and Uhla Prue as Social Welfare Secretary.
Birendra Kishore Roaza popularly known as B K Roaza was a veteran politician and social activist who was elected as the founder president of PCJSS. In the first election in the national life of the Jumma people in CHT enjoyed the democratic right to vote, in the East Pakistan Provincial Assembly elections in 1954, B K Roaza was elected as a member of the Provincial Assembly from the Scheduled Community seat. Although the right to vote was not able to bring radical changes in the social life of Jumma peoples, it can be considered as a milestone in gaining democratic rights. B K Roaza was associated with politics since his student life. He was always vocal in the development and establishment of fundamental rights of the neglected and deprived people of CHT.","Can you identify the factors that contributed to the decline of the Jumma people's political movement in the 1980s, and how did it affect the trajectory of their struggle for self-governance?","The factors that contributed to the decline of the Jumma people's political movement in the 1980s were complex and multifaceted. Some of the key factors that emerged from the search results include:

1. Adverse weather conditions, political instability, or economic factors: These factors can contribute to the decline of a political movement by creating an unfavorable environment for its survival and growth.
2. Inadequacies in the Political Declaration: The Political Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples was adopted by the United Nations in 2007, but it has been criticized for its lack of specificity and implementation. This can lead to a decline in the political movement as indigenous peoples become disillusioned with the lack of progress.
3. Non-communicable diseases: Non-communicable diseases, such as diabetes and heart disease, can contribute to the decline of a political movement by reducing the number of active participants and leaders.
4. Push and pull factors: Push and pull factors, such as economic opportunities or political instability, can contribute to the decline of a political movement by creating an environment that is unfavorable to its survival and growth.
5. Lack of support from external actors: The lack of support from external actors, such as governments or international organizations, can contribute to the decline of a political movement by reducing its ability to access resources and influence.

The trajectory of the Jumma people's struggle for self-governance was likely affected by these factors, as well as others. The movement may have faced challenges in maintaining its momentum and achieving its goals due to the complex and multifaceted nature of the factors that contributed to its decline.","['https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8559768/', 'https://www.marines.mil/portals/1/Publications/Dominican%20Republic%20and%20Haiti%20Study_1.pdf', 'https://www.amnesty.org/en/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/English.pdf', 'https://capstone.ndu.edu/Portals/83/20-2%20Africa%20Field%20Study%20Book%20II%20Final%20reduced%20Part%20II.pdf', 'https://ums.org/2019/06/21/from-margins-to-mainstream-tap-dance-history/', 'https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000380618', 'https://library.fes.de/pdf-files/bueros/amman/14224.pdf', 'https://www.iwgia.org/images/publications/making_the_declaration_work.pdf', 'https://press.un.org/en/2011/ga11138.doc.htm', 'https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/cr/cf/documents/esmcchapter4.pdf', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8559768/', 'https://www.marines.mil/portals/1/Publications/Dominican%20Republic%20and%20Haiti%20Study_1.pdf', 'https://www.amnesty.org/en/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/English.pdf', 'https://capstone.ndu.edu/Portals/83/20-2%20Africa%20Field%20Study%20Book%20II%20Final%20reduced%20Part%20II.pdf', 'https://ums.org/2019/06/21/from-margins-to-mainstream-tap-dance-history/', 'https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000380618', 'https://library.fes.de/pdf-files/bueros/amman/14224.pdf', 'https://www.iwgia.org/images/publications/making_the_declaration_work.pdf', 'https://press.un.org/en/2011/ga11138.doc.htm', 'https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/cr/cf/documents/esmcchapter4.pdf', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8559768/', 'https://www.marines.mil/portals/1/Publications/Dominican%20Republic%20and%20Haiti%20Study_1.pdf', 'https://www.amnesty.org/en/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/English.pdf', 'https://capstone.ndu.edu/Portals/83/20-2%20Africa%20Field%20Study%20Book%20II%20Final%20reduced%20Part%20II.pdf', 'https://ums.org/2019/06/21/from-margins-to-mainstream-tap-dance-history/', 'https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000380618', 'https://library.fes.de/pdf-files/bueros/amman/14224.pdf', 'https://www.iwgia.org/images/publications/making_the_declaration_work.pdf', 'https://press.un.org/en/2011/ga11138.doc.htm', 'https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/cr/cf/documents/esmcchapter4.pdf']",politics

B K Roaza was associated with politics since his student life. He was always vocal in the development and establishment of fundamental rights of the neglected and deprived people of CHT.","What were the primary causes of the widespread disillusionment with the political process in Bangladesh in the early 1970s, and how did this disillusionment contribute to the formation of the PCJSS?","The primary causes of disillusionment with the political process in Bangladesh in the early 1970s were multifaceted and complex, involving a combination of political, economic, and social factors.","['https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/pcgn/hd_pcgn.htm', 'https://carnegieendowment.org/2023/09/05/polarization-democracy-and-political-violence-in-united-states-what-research-says-pub-90457', 'https://www.idea.int/sites/default/files/publications/voter-turnout-trends-around-the-world.pdf', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1970_Bhola_cyclone', 'https://history.state.gov/milestones/1969-1976/detente', 'https://www.economist.com/news/essays/21596796-democracy-was-most-successful-political-idea-20th-century-why-has-it-run-trouble-and-what-can-be-do', 'https://www.jstor.org/stable/26201037', 'https://publications.iom.int/system/files/pdf/wmr_2020.pdf', 'https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/410/113/', 'https://www.unodc.org/documents/justice-and-prison-reform/Child-Victims/Handbook_on_Children_Recruited_and_Exploited_by_Terrorist_and_Violent_Extremist_Groups_the_Role_of_the_Justice_System.E.pdf', 'https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/pcgn/hd_pcgn.htm', 'https://carnegieendowment.org/2023/09/05/polarization-democracy-and-political-violence-in-united-states-what-research-says-pub-90457', 'https://www.idea.int/sites/default/files/publications/voter-turnout-trends-around-the-world.pdf', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1970_Bhola_cyclone', 'https://history.state.gov/milestones/1969-1976/detente', 'https://www.economist.com/news/essays/21596796-democracy-was-most-successful-political-idea-20th-century-why-has-it-run-trouble-and-what-can-be-do', 'https://www.jstor.org/stable/26201037', 'https://publications.iom.int/system/files/pdf/wmr_2020.pdf', 'https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/410/113/', 'https://www.unodc.org/documents/justice-and-prison-reform/Child-Victims/Handbook_on_Children_Recruited_and_Exploited_by_Terrorist_and_Violent_Extremist_Groups_the_Role_of_the_Justice_System.E.pdf', 'https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/pcgn/hd_pcgn.htm', 'https://carnegieendowment.org/2023/09/05/polarization-democracy-and-political-violence-in-united-states-what-research-says-pub-90457', 'https://www.idea.int/sites/default/files/publications/voter-turnout-trends-around-the-world.pdf', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1970_Bhola_cyclone', 'https://history.state.gov/milestones/1969-1976/detente', 'https://www.economist.com/news/essays/21596796-democracy-was-most-successful-political-idea-20th-century-why-has-it-run-trouble-and-what-can-be-do', 'https://www.jstor.org/stable/26201037', 'https://publications.iom.int/system/files/pdf/wmr_2020.pdf', 'https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/410/113/', 'https://www.unodc.org/documents/justice-and-prison-reform/Child-Victims/Handbook_on_Children_Recruited_and_Exploited_by_Terrorist_and_Violent_Extremist_Groups_the_Role_of_the_Justice_System.E.pdf', 'https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/pcgn/hd_pcgn.htm', 'https://carnegieendowment.org/2023/09/05/polarization-democracy-and-political-violence-in-united-states-what-research-says-pub-90457', 'https://www.idea.int/sites/default/files/publications/voter-turnout-trends-around-the-world.pdf', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1970_Bhola_cyclone', 'https://history.state.gov/milestones/1969-1976/detente', 'https://www.economist.com/news/essays/21596796-democracy-was-most-successful-political-idea-20th-century-why-has-it-run-trouble-and-what-can-be-do', 'https://www.jstor.org/stable/26201037', 'https://publications.iom.int/system/files/pdf/wmr_2020.pdf', 'https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/410/113/', 'https://www.unodc.org/documents/justice-and-prison-reform/Child-Victims/Handbook_on_Children_Recruited_and_Exploited_by_Terrorist_and_Violent_Extremist_Groups_the_Role_of_the_Justice_System.E.pdf']",politics
"In one hand, due to the oppression of the Awami League government and its collaborators, and on the other, due to the harassment of the miscreants, the lives of the Jumma peoples became miserable. The people came to the brink of life and death in a state of utter helplessness. A stalemate ensued throughout the region. The Jumma people especially felt the lack of a political party at such a time. These events made it more clear to the Jumma society that these oppressed and deprived peoples have no alternative way to survive except struggle. And a well-organized movement requires a political party of its own. The Parbatya Chattagram Parichalana Committee (CHT Election Running Committee), formed in 1970, stood by the Jumma people during the most disastrous days of national life in the newly independent Bangladesh and continued to deal with the situation with determination. Along with that, the process of forming an own political party also went ahead.
Due to the geographical, socio-economic and political context of CHT, distinct governance system and unique the culture and ethnic identity of the Jumma people, most of the conscious students and intellectuals including M N Larma, Santu Larma, Ananta Bihari Khisa, Amiya Sen Chakma and Kali Madhab Chakma were in favor of forming own political party to protect the legitimate rights of the Jumma peoples of CHT at that time. At this time, instead of forming a new political party, the idea arose to revive the Parbatya Chattagram Jana Samiti formed in the British period. As a result, the acceptance of the political party will be achieved, as well as the work of strengthening as a political party will be easier. At that time M N Larma along with some companions discussed with Kamini Mohan Dewan, former president of Parbatya Chattagram Jana Samity. He opined that since Parbatya Chattagram Jana Samiti was banned during the Pakistan period, a new party under this name would not be appropriate.

The Jumma people, who are indigenous to the CHT, have faced significant challenges in their economic development due to the lack of infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and communication networks. This has limited their access to markets, education, and healthcare, and has hindered their ability to participate in the national economy.

Natural resource exploitation has also had a significant impact on the Jumma people's economic development. The CHT is rich in natural resources, including forests, minerals, and water, which have been exploited by the government and private companies. This has led to environmental degradation, displacement of communities, and loss of livelihoods for the Jumma people.

Government policies have also played a significant role in the Jumma people's economic development. The government has implemented policies that have favored the interests of non-indigenous people, such as the allocation of land and resources to non-indigenous settlers. This has led to the displacement of Jumma people from their ancestral lands and the erosion of their cultural identity.

The PCJSS, a organization that represents the Jumma people, has struggled to promote their rights and interests in the face of government opposition and lack of support from the international community. The PCJSS has called for the recognition of the Jumma people's rights to their ancestral lands, the protection of their cultural identity, and the promotion of their economic development through sustainable and equitable means.

In conclusion, the economic development of the Jumma people in the Chittagong Hill Tracts is a complex issue that is influenced by various factors, including lack of infrastructure, natural resource exploitation, and government policies. The PCJSS has struggled to promote the Jumma people's rights and interests, and it is essential that the government and international community take steps to address these issues and promote the economic development of the Jumma people in a sustainable and equitable manner.","['https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14616688.2023.2231424', 'https://peaceaccords.nd.edu/provision/economic-and-social-development-chittagong-hill-tracts-peace-accord-cht', 'https://alochonaa.com/2014/03/18/the-power-of-cultural-symbols-the-future-of-the-chittagong-hill-tracts-indigenous-people/', 'https://peaceaccords.nd.edu/provision/refugees-chittagong-hill-tracts-peace-accord-cht', 'https://documents.un.org/api/symbol/access?j=N1424814&t=pdf', 'https://seeingthewoods.org/2014/07/15/socio-politico-economic-problems-in-the-hilly-areas-of-bangladesh-the-case-of-the-chittagong-hill-tracts/', 'https://humanrights.gov.au/our-work/projects/2005-international-conference-engaging-communities-international-conference', 'https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/documents/issues/internaldisplacement/cfis/thematic-priorities/subm-thematic-priorities-sr-cso-civil-society-organisations-networks.pdf', 'https://www.iwgia.org/images/publications/0577_Igia_report_14_optimized.pdf', 'https://researchnow.flinders.edu.au/en/publications/tourism-as-a-vehicle-of-reconciliation-in-post-conflict-banglades', 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14616688.2023.2231424', 'https://peaceaccords.nd.edu/provision/economic-and-social-development-chittagong-hill-tracts-peace-accord-cht', 'https://alochonaa.com/2014/03/18/the-power-of-cultural-symbols-the-future-of-the-chittagong-hill-tracts-indigenous-people/', 'https://peaceaccords.nd.edu/provision/refugees-chittagong-hill-tracts-peace-accord-cht', 'https://documents.un.org/api/symbol/access?j=N1424814&t=pdf', 'https://seeingthewoods.org/2014/07/15/socio-politico-economic-problems-in-the-hilly-areas-of-bangladesh-the-case-of-the-chittagong-hill-tracts/', 'https://humanrights.gov.au/our-work/projects/2005-international-conference-engaging-communities-international-conference', 'https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/documents/issues/internaldisplacement/cfis/thematic-priorities/subm-thematic-priorities-sr-cso-civil-society-organisations-networks.pdf', 'https://www.iwgia.org/images/publications/0577_Igia_report_14_optimized.pdf', 'https://researchnow.flinders.edu.au/en/publications/tourism-as-a-vehicle-of-reconciliation-in-post-conflict-banglades', 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14616688.2023.2231424', 'https://peaceaccords.nd.edu/provision/economic-and-social-development-chittagong-hill-tracts-peace-accord-cht', 'https://alochonaa.com/2014/03/18/the-power-of-cultural-symbols-the-future-of-the-chittagong-hill-tracts-indigenous-people/', 'https://peaceaccords.nd.edu/provision/refugees-chittagong-hill-tracts-peace-accord-cht', 'https://documents.un.org/api/symbol/access?j=N1424814&t=pdf', 'https://seeingthewoods.org/2014/07/15/socio-politico-economic-problems-in-the-hilly-areas-of-bangladesh-the-case-of-the-chittagong-hill-tracts/', 'https://humanrights.gov.au/our-work/projects/2005-international-conference-engaging-communities-international-conference', 'https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/documents/issues/internaldisplacement/cfis/thematic-priorities/subm-thematic-priorities-sr-cso-civil-society-organisations-networks.pdf', 'https://www.iwgia.org/images/publications/0577_Igia_report_14_optimized.pdf', 'https://researchnow.flinders.edu.au/en/publications/tourism-as-a-vehicle-of-reconciliation-in-post-conflict-banglades']",politics

1. Crackdown on independent and opposition voices: The government has been systematically cracking down on independent and opposition voices, using various means such as arrests, detention, and intimidation.

2. Suppression of dissenting voices: The government has been using members of law enforcement agencies and security forces to suppress dissenting voices and law enforcement agencies to silence opposition voices.

3. Enactment of restrictive laws: The government has enacted laws that restrict freedom of expression, such as the Digital Security Act, which has been criticized for its vague language and potential for abuse.

4. Use of propaganda: The government has been using propaganda to discredit and silence opposition voices, portraying them as anti-state and anti-development.

5. Intimidation and harassment: The government has been using intimidation and harassment to silence opposition voices, including physical attacks, threats, and arrests.

6. Control of media: The government has been controlling the media, restricting access to information, and silencing critical voices.

7. Use of surveillance: The government has been using surveillance to monitor and track opposition voices, including online activities.

8. Crackdown on civil society: The government has been cracking down on civil society organizations, including human rights groups, NGOs, and trade unions, which have been critical of the government's human rights record.

These strategies have had a significant impact on the prospects of other political parties vying for power, as they have been unable to operate freely and have been subject to repression and intimidation.","['https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/press-release/2017/05/bangladesh-dissenting-voices-trapped-between-fear-and-repression/', 'https://freedomhouse.org/article/fighting-back-against-awami-leagues-clampdown-democratic-space', 'https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/press-release/2021/07/bangladesh-end-crackdown-on-freedom-of-expression-online/', 'https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/12/13/bangladesh-crackdown-elections-loom', 'https://bti-project.org/en/reports/country-report/BGD', 'https://www.fidh.org/en/region/asia/bangladesh/bangladesh-government-must-stop-enforced-disappearances', 'https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/30/why-is-the-bangladeshi-opposition-protesting-against-sheikh-hasinas-govt', 'https://monitor.civicus.org/explore/bangladesh-government-continues-targeting-activists-and-criminalising-opposition-members-ahead-of-un-human-rights-review/', 'https://www.voanews.com/a/bangladesh-court-grants-bail-to-sister-of-exiled-journalist-/6492205.html', 'https://thediplomat.com/2018/10/bangladesh-enacts-new-law-that-could-silence-dissenters/', 'https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/press-release/2017/05/bangladesh-dissenting-voices-trapped-between-fear-and-repression/', 'https://freedomhouse.org/article/fighting-back-against-awami-leagues-clampdown-democratic-space', 'https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/press-release/2021/07/bangladesh-end-crackdown-on-freedom-of-expression-online/', 'https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/12/13/bangladesh-crackdown-elections-loom', 'https://bti-project.org/en/reports/country-report/BGD', 'https://www.fidh.org/en/region/asia/bangladesh/bangladesh-government-must-stop-enforced-disappearances', 'https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/30/why-is-the-bangladeshi-opposition-protesting-against-sheikh-hasinas-govt', 'https://monitor.civicus.org/explore/bangladesh-government-continues-targeting-activists-and-criminalising-opposition-members-ahead-of-un-human-rights-review/', 'https://www.voanews.com/a/bangladesh-court-grants-bail-to-sister-of-exiled-journalist-/6492205.html', 'https://thediplomat.com/2018/10/bangladesh-enacts-new-law-that-could-silence-dissenters/', 'https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/press-release/2017/05/bangladesh-dissenting-voices-trapped-between-fear-and-repression/', 'https://freedomhouse.org/article/fighting-back-against-awami-leagues-clampdown-democratic-space', 'https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/press-release/2021/07/bangladesh-end-crackdown-on-freedom-of-expression-online/', 'https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/12/13/bangladesh-crackdown-elections-loom', 'https://bti-project.org/en/reports/country-report/BGD', 'https://www.fidh.org/en/region/asia/bangladesh/bangladesh-government-must-stop-enforced-disappearances', 'https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/30/why-is-the-bangladeshi-opposition-protesting-against-sheikh-hasinas-govt', 'https://monitor.civicus.org/explore/bangladesh-government-continues-targeting-activists-and-criminalising-opposition-members-ahead-of-un-human-rights-review/', 'https://www.voanews.com/a/bangladesh-court-grants-bail-to-sister-of-exiled-journalist-/6492205.html', 'https://thediplomat.com/2018/10/bangladesh-enacts-new-law-that-could-silence-dissenters/']",politics
"|Republic of Kenya

(22 Ministries of Kenya)
The Government of the Republic of Kenya (GoK) is the national government of the Republic of Kenya, a federal republic located in East Africa, composed of 47 Counties, each county with its own semi-autonomous governments, including the national capital of Nairobi, where the national government is primarily based.
The national government is composed of three distinct branches: The Legislature (Parliament), the Executive and the Judiciary. Each arm is independent of the other and their individual roles are set by the Constitution of Kenya while their powers and duties are further defined by acts of Parliament.
The full name of the country is the ""Republic of Kenya"". Its official Swahili name is ""Jamhuri ya Kenya"". No other names appear in the Constitution, and these are the names that appear on the country's currency, in treaties, and in legal cases to which the nation is a party.
Other terms such as ""GoK"", ""GK"" and ""Serikali"" are often used officially and informally to distinguish the national government from the county governments.
The Government's structure consists of power shared between the national government and the county governments. It has hints of a federal state like Ethiopia, Nigeria, Somalia and the United States where power has almost entirely been delegated to states. However, most elements point to the country being a unitary state with some degree of autonomy in the Counties of Kenya as is the case in a country such as France. Kenya is therefore a unitary state with a decentralised system as per the new Constitution of Kenya 2010. It is essential that decentralisation/semi-autonomy not be confused with federalism as they aren't exactly similar concepts. Spain has autonomous communities yet it isn't exactly considered a federal state like Germany or Ethiopia.
Originally the central government delegated power through devolution since gaining independence from the United Kingdom in 1963 until the country held a referendum in 2010 to amend the Constitution, among which amendments was the devolving of certain powers and duties of the national government to the semi-autonomous governments of the newly-created counties.
The country was initially led by a Prime Minister, but upon the country becoming a full republic in 1964, the Prime Minister's title was changed to President of Kenya.
The current structure of government allows power to be held on two levels: The national level and the county level.
The country is a representative democracy legislatively, and a direct democracy in the election of its president, who is leader of the Executive branch of government.
The Legislative branch is known as the Parliament of Kenya, and is established under Chapter Eight of the Constitution. It is bicameral, comprising the National Assembly and the Senate. The Legislature is primarily mandated with legislation within the country and is organised as follows:
The National Assembly is made up of 349 elected members (known as Member of Parliament or MP), consisting of 290 members elected from constituencies within the counties, 47 women elected at county-level, 12 nominated representatives and the Speaker, who is an ex-officio member. Each of the 290 members represents the constituency from where they were elected. The members of Parliament serve five-year terms..
In order to be elected as a member of the National Assembly, an individual must be registered as a voter, satisfies any requirements prescribed by the Constitution or by an act of Parliament and is nominated by a political party, or is an independent candidate.
All members are elected or nominated, including the Speaker, who is elected from persons qualified to be elected as members of Parliament but are not members.
In contrast, the Senate is made up of 47 Senators representing each of the 47 counties, 16 women nominated by political parties according to the parties' proportions in the Senate, one man and woman to represent the youth, one man and women to represent persons with disabilities, and the Speaker, who is also an ex-officio member like the National Assembly's Speaker.
The National Assembly and Senate each have particular powers. The National Assembly mainly deals with legislation affecting the country at the national level as well as exercising oversight over the national government while the Senate mainly deals with legislation concerning counties as well as exercising oversight over the county governments. However, both Houses' approval is required in any matter so determined by an act of Parliament, such as presidential appointments to the Executive and Judiciary, military officers and ambassadors.","What is the most effective way to address the issue of corruption in Kenya, considering the country's recent constitutional reforms and decentralized governance structure?","The most effective way to address corruption in Kenya, considering the country's recent constitutional reforms and decentralized governance structure, is a multifaceted approach that involves a combination of measures. These measures include:

1. Strengthening institutions: The government should focus on strengthening institutions such as the judiciary, the police, and the anti-corruption agencies to ensure that they are effective and independent.
2. Decentralization: Decentralization can help to reduce corruption by giving more power to local communities and allowing them to make decisions about their own development.
3. Transparency and accountability: The government should ensure that all government activities are transparent and accountable, and that citizens have access to information about government decisions and actions.
4. Education and awareness: Education and awareness campaigns can help to reduce corruption by promoting a culture of integrity and ethical behavior.
5. Community engagement: Community engagement and participation can help to reduce corruption by empowering citizens to take an active role in monitoring and reporting corruption.
6. Technology: Technology can be used to reduce corruption by providing a platform for citizens to report corruption and for the government to track and monitor corruption.
7. International cooperation: International cooperation can help to reduce corruption by providing a framework for countries to share information and best practices on anti-corruption efforts.

These measures should be implemented in a way that is tailored to the specific context of Kenya and that takes into account the country's recent constitutional reforms and decentralized governance structure.","['https://blogs.worldbank.org/en/governance/here-are-10-ways-fight-corruption', 'https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/six-practical-ways-government-kenya-could-fight-ir%C5%A9ng%C5%A9-houghton-5mnge', 'https://www.state.gov/combating-corruption-and-promoting-good-governance/', 'https://www.unodc.org/documents/corruption/Publications/2019/19-08373_Scaling_Back_Corruption_ebook.pdf', 'https://www.usip.org/publications/2019/09/conflict-prevention-kenya-combating-corruption-through-nonviolent-action', 'http://obamaspeeches.com/088-An-Honest-Government-A-Hopeful-Future-Obama-Speech.htm', 'https://www.transparency.org/en/news/international-youth-day-15-ways-young-people-can-fight-corruption', 'https://www.publicsafety.gc.ca/cnt/rsrcs/pblctns/2023-r010/index-en.aspx', 'https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/19_0920_plcy_strategic-framework-countering-terrorism-targeted-violence.pdf', 'https://www.imf.org/EXTERNAL/PUBS/FT/ISSUES6/INDEX.HTM', 'https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/19_0920_plcy_strategic-framework-countering-terrorism-targeted-violence.pdf', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7734391/', 'https://www.unodc.org/pdf/criminal_justice/Handbook_on_police_Accountability_Oversight_and_Integrity.pdf', 'https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/expend/guide4.htm', 'https://www.unodc.org/documents/corruption/Publications/2020/THE_TIME_IS_NOW_2020_12_08.pdf', 'https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2015/cr15340.pdf', 'https://press.un.org/en/2023/sc15249.doc.htm', 'https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/235541600116631094/pdf/Enhancing-Government-Effectiveness-and-Transparency-The-Fight-Against-Corruption.pdf', 'https://www.crisisgroup.org/global/exploiting-disorder-al-qaeda-and-islamic-state', 'https://peacemaker.un.org/sites/peacemaker.un.org/files/PracticalGuidetoConstitutionBuilding_IDEA2011.pdf', 'https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/19_0920_plcy_strategic-framework-countering-terrorism-targeted-violence.pdf', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7734391/', 'https://www.unodc.org/pdf/criminal_justice/Handbook_on_police_Accountability_Oversight_and_Integrity.pdf', 'https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/expend/guide4.htm', 'https://www.unodc.org/documents/corruption/Publications/2020/THE_TIME_IS_NOW_2020_12_08.pdf', 'https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2015/cr15340.pdf', 'https://press.un.org/en/2023/sc15249.doc.htm', 'https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/235541600116631094/pdf/Enhancing-Government-Effectiveness-and-Transparency-The-Fight-Against-Corruption.pdf', 'https://www.crisisgroup.org/global/exploiting-disorder-al-qaeda-and-islamic-state', 'https://peacemaker.un.org/sites/peacemaker.un.org/files/PracticalGuidetoConstitutionBuilding_IDEA2011.pdf']",politics

The Government of the Republic of Kenya (GoK) is the national government of the Republic of Kenya, a federal republic located in East Africa, composed of 47 Counties, each county with its own semi-autonomous governments, including the national capital of Nairobi, where the national government is primarily based.
The national government is composed of three distinct branches: The Legislature (Parliament), the Executive and the Judiciary. Each arm is independent of the other and their individual roles are set by the Constitution of Kenya while their powers and duties are further defined by acts of Parliament.
The full name of the country is the ""Republic of Kenya"". Its official Swahili name is ""Jamhuri ya Kenya"". No other names appear in the Constitution, and these are the names that appear on the country's currency, in treaties, and in legal cases to which the nation is a party.
Other terms such as ""GoK"", ""GK"" and ""Serikali"" are often used officially and informally to distinguish the national government from the county governments.
The Government's structure consists of power shared between the national government and the county governments. It has hints of a federal state like Ethiopia, Nigeria, Somalia and the United States where power has almost entirely been delegated to states. However, most elements point to the country being a unitary state with some degree of autonomy in the Counties of Kenya as is the case in a country such as France. Kenya is therefore a unitary state with a decentralised system as per the new Constitution of Kenya 2010. It is essential that decentralisation/semi-autonomy not be confused with federalism as they aren't exactly similar concepts. Spain has autonomous communities yet it isn't exactly considered a federal state like Germany or Ethiopia.
Originally the central government delegated power through devolution since gaining independence from the United Kingdom in 1963 until the country held a referendum in 2010 to amend the Constitution, among which amendments was the devolving of certain powers and duties of the national government to the semi-autonomous governments of the newly-created counties.
The country was initially led by a Prime Minister, but upon the country becoming a full republic in 1964, the Prime Minister's title was changed to President of Kenya.
The current structure of government allows power to be held on two levels: The national level and the county level.
The country is a representative democracy legislatively, and a direct democracy in the election of its president, who is leader of the Executive branch of government.
The Legislative branch is known as the Parliament of Kenya, and is established under Chapter Eight of the Constitution. It is bicameral, comprising the National Assembly and the Senate. The Legislature is primarily mandated with legislation within the country and is organised as follows:
The National Assembly is made up of 349 elected members (known as Member of Parliament or MP), consisting of 290 members elected from constituencies within the counties, 47 women elected at county-level, 12 nominated representatives and the Speaker, who is an ex-officio member. Each of the 290 members represents the constituency from where they were elected. The members of Parliament serve five-year terms..
In order to be elected as a member of the National Assembly, an individual must be registered as a voter, satisfies any requirements prescribed by the Constitution or by an act of Parliament and is nominated by a political party, or is an independent candidate.
All members are elected or nominated, including the Speaker, who is elected from persons qualified to be elected as members of Parliament but are not members.
In contrast, the Senate is made up of 47 Senators representing each of the 47 counties, 16 women nominated by political parties according to the parties' proportions in the Senate, one man and woman to represent the youth, one man and women to represent persons with disabilities, and the Speaker, who is also an ex-officio member like the National Assembly's Speaker.

However, both Houses' approval is required in any matter so determined by an act of Parliament, such as presidential appointments to the Executive and Judiciary, military officers and ambassadors.","What is the procedure for resolving a deadlock in the National Assembly, and how does this impact the functioning of the government as a whole?","The procedure for resolving deadlocks in the National Assembly is crucial to ensure the smooth functioning of the government. The Constitution provides a method for resolving deadlocks, which might arise in the event of a disagreement between the two houses. If the Senate twice rejects a bill, it is sent to a joint committee for further discussion and negotiation.","['https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/Senate_Briefs/Brief07', 'https://www.archives.gov/electoral-college/faq', 'https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/the-un-general-assembly-condemns-russia-but-what-can-it-actually-do/', 'https://www.idea.int/sites/default/files/publications/bicameralism-primer.pdf', 'https://agsiw.org/the-politics-of-permanent-deadlock-in-kuwait/', 'https://www.europarl.europa.eu/about-parliament/en/powers-and-procedures/legislative-powers', 'https://apnews.com/article/france-elections-far-right-macron-08f10a7416a2494c85dcd562f33401d1', 'https://www.europarl.europa.eu/cmsdata/233740/AFCO%20Working%20Document%20on%20Overcoming%20the%20Deadlock%20of%20Unanimity%20Voting.pdf', 'https://www.jud.ct.gov/lawlib/history/sherman.htm', 'https://www.senate.gov/about/origins-foundations/senate-and-constitution/seventeenth-amendment.htm', 'https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/Senate_Briefs/Brief07', 'https://www.archives.gov/electoral-college/faq', 'https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/the-un-general-assembly-condemns-russia-but-what-can-it-actually-do/', 'https://www.idea.int/sites/default/files/publications/bicameralism-primer.pdf', 'https://agsiw.org/the-politics-of-permanent-deadlock-in-kuwait/', 'https://www.europarl.europa.eu/about-parliament/en/powers-and-procedures/legislative-powers', 'https://apnews.com/article/france-elections-far-right-macron-08f10a7416a2494c85dcd562f33401d1', 'https://www.europarl.europa.eu/cmsdata/233740/AFCO%20Working%20Document%20on%20Overcoming%20the%20Deadlock%20of%20Unanimity%20Voting.pdf', 'https://www.jud.ct.gov/lawlib/history/sherman.htm', 'https://www.senate.gov/about/origins-foundations/senate-and-constitution/seventeenth-amendment.htm', 'https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/Senate_Briefs/Brief07', 'https://www.archives.gov/electoral-college/faq', 'https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/the-un-general-assembly-condemns-russia-but-what-can-it-actually-do/', 'https://www.idea.int/sites/default/files/publications/bicameralism-primer.pdf', 'https://agsiw.org/the-politics-of-permanent-deadlock-in-kuwait/', 'https://www.europarl.europa.eu/about-parliament/en/powers-and-procedures/legislative-powers', 'https://apnews.com/article/france-elections-far-right-macron-08f10a7416a2494c85dcd562f33401d1', 'https://www.europarl.europa.eu/cmsdata/233740/AFCO%20Working%20Document%20on%20Overcoming%20the%20Deadlock%20of%20Unanimity%20Voting.pdf', 'https://www.jud.ct.gov/lawlib/history/sherman.htm', 'https://www.senate.gov/about/origins-foundations/senate-and-constitution/seventeenth-amendment.htm', 'https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/Senate_Briefs/Brief07', 'https://www.archives.gov/electoral-college/faq', 'https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/the-un-general-assembly-condemns-russia-but-what-can-it-actually-do/', 'https://www.idea.int/sites/default/files/publications/bicameralism-primer.pdf', 'https://agsiw.org/the-politics-of-permanent-deadlock-in-kuwait/', 'https://www.europarl.europa.eu/about-parliament/en/powers-and-procedures/legislative-powers', 'https://apnews.com/article/france-elections-far-right-macron-08f10a7416a2494c85dcd562f33401d1', 'https://www.europarl.europa.eu/cmsdata/233740/AFCO%20Working%20Document%20on%20Overcoming%20the%20Deadlock%20of%20Unanimity%20Voting.pdf', 'https://www.jud.ct.gov/lawlib/history/sherman.htm', 'https://www.senate.gov/about/origins-foundations/senate-and-constitution/seventeenth-amendment.htm']",politics

Copyright ©2005-2018 EnchantedLearning.com ------ How to cite a web page",How would a politician's ability to express dissenting views in a public forum influence the overall decision-making process in a local government?,"The ability of a politician to express dissenting views in a public forum can have a significant impact on the overall decision-making process in a local government. This impact can be seen from multiple perspectives.

From a democratic perspective, the ability to express dissenting views is essential for ensuring that the voices of all citizens are heard and considered in the decision-making process. When politicians are able to express their dissenting views, it encourages other politicians to do the same, leading to a more diverse and inclusive discussion of the issues.

From a practical perspective, the ability to express dissenting views can also influence the decision-making process by providing an alternative perspective that may not have been considered otherwise. This can lead to a more informed and well-rounded decision that takes into account the diverse views of the community.

From a legal perspective, the ability to express dissenting views is protected by the First Amendment to the US Constitution, which guarantees the right to freedom of speech and expression. This means that politicians have a constitutional right to express their dissenting views, even if they are unpopular or go against the majority opinion.

In conclusion, the ability of a politician to express dissenting views in a public forum can have a significant impact on the overall decision-making process in a local government. This impact can be seen from multiple perspectives, including democratic, practical, and legal perspectives.","['https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/22-451_7m58.pdf', 'https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/446/55/', 'https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/19-1392_6j37.pdf', 'https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fandd/issues/2023/03/diverse-views-in-monetary-policy-blanchflower-levin', 'https://www.uscourts.gov/about-federal-courts/educational-resources/about-educational-outreach/activity-resources/supreme-1', 'https://www.fec.gov/legal-resources/court-cases/citizens-united-v-fec/', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S001429212100180X', 'https://www.uscourts.gov/educational-resources/educational-activities/history-brown-v-board-education-re-enactment', 'https://www.mcguirewoods.com/client-resources/alerts/2013/12/robinson-township-v-commonwealth/', 'https://ncfsc-web.squiz.cloud/__data/assets/pdf_file/0026/16685/brooding-spirit-of-the-law.pdf', 'https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/22-451_7m58.pdf', 'https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/446/55/', 'https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/19-1392_6j37.pdf', 'https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fandd/issues/2023/03/diverse-views-in-monetary-policy-blanchflower-levin', 'https://www.uscourts.gov/about-federal-courts/educational-resources/about-educational-outreach/activity-resources/supreme-1', 'https://www.fec.gov/legal-resources/court-cases/citizens-united-v-fec/', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S001429212100180X', 'https://www.uscourts.gov/educational-resources/educational-activities/history-brown-v-board-education-re-enactment', 'https://www.mcguirewoods.com/client-resources/alerts/2013/12/robinson-township-v-commonwealth/', 'https://ncfsc-web.squiz.cloud/__data/assets/pdf_file/0026/16685/brooding-spirit-of-the-law.pdf', 'https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/22-451_7m58.pdf', 'https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/446/55/', 'https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/19-1392_6j37.pdf', 'https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fandd/issues/2023/03/diverse-views-in-monetary-policy-blanchflower-levin', 'https://www.uscourts.gov/about-federal-courts/educational-resources/about-educational-outreach/activity-resources/supreme-1', 'https://www.fec.gov/legal-resources/court-cases/citizens-united-v-fec/', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S001429212100180X', 'https://www.uscourts.gov/educational-resources/educational-activities/history-brown-v-board-education-re-enactment', 'https://www.mcguirewoods.com/client-resources/alerts/2013/12/robinson-township-v-commonwealth/', 'https://ncfsc-web.squiz.cloud/__data/assets/pdf_file/0026/16685/brooding-spirit-of-the-law.pdf']",politics

"Even a seemingly non-contentious issue like the arts can be undermined by problematic organizing ideas.
Strong default organizing idea: Arts as entertainment – people may have strong and positive feelings about the arts, while seeing them through the lens of personal entertainment. In this view, entertainment is a “luxury,” and the “market” will determine which arts offerings survive, based on people’s tastes as consumers of entertainment. Consequently, public support for the arts makes little sense, particularly when public funds are scarce.
More constructive organizing idea: The arts create ripple effects of benefits, such as vibrant, thriving neighborhoods where we all want to live and work. This is not only compelling, but it also sets an expectation for public responsibility for the arts.
A number of leading experts and public officials of both political parties advocate for a nuclear-free world. However, the public is largely unconvinced so far.
Strong default organizing idea: Nukes keep us safe – Nuclear weapons are often viewed as simply our most destructive weapon, therefore our biggest and best tool for self-protection, essentially a shield. In this frame, disarmament sounds like we are voluntarily giving up our security, or (“cutting off our arm” as the cartoon at right suggests) and advocates sound naïvely idealistic at best.
More constructive organizing idea: Nukes create risk in today’s world, rather than reduce it – Nuclear weapons are a liability, because they don’t help with current risks. You can’t nuke terrorists, but terrorists could get their hands on nukes. And the sheer volume means there is a lot of opportunity for accident or theft, leading to destruction that affects us all. In this view, nukes (including our own) are like a ticking bomb in the basement.
In all these cases, shifting to a new organizing idea means arriving at new conclusions about important questions such as:
- Who are the relevant players?
- What’s at stake?
- What solutions make sense?
Leading vs. Following
Unfortunately, effective communication often isn’t as simple as helping people shift to a different, familiar perspective. It can be very hard work developing and promoting what is essentially a new organizing idea – and it often means moving outside an organization’s comfort zone.
In an important sense, much advocacy is currently defensive – working within Americans’ existing, default understandings. For instance, advocates may feel obligated to sound “tough” on security or immigration – even if these stances don’t fit the policies they promote – or to avoid discussing unpopular or complicated positions (such as nuclear disarmament or carbon limits). And strategists often reinforce this instinct by viewing public opinion as a constraint on discourse – politicians either “can” or “can’t” take certain positions based on the popular views measured in surveys, for instance.
But real change often isn’t possible unless advocates make an effective case for a position that is currently unpopular or poorly understood. While daunting, it is critical to go on the offense and work to fundamentally reshape how people think about an issue. An effective organizing idea should not only “win” in the short-term, but also set the right dynamic in motion for long-term policy.
For example, a focus on the physical and organizational “public structures” that underlie American prosperity creates the foundation for a new kind of conversation. It helps people recognize the value and importance of the public sector, and helps them transcend knee-jerk dismissal of government.
Of course, identifying organizing ideas with this potential is usually not easy. But developing them can make the difference between creating the space for real change, and simply making the best of what we perceive as unfortunate limits on progress.
“New Common Sense”
To be truly effective, an organizing idea must strike people as common sense when they hear it.
In nearly every issue area, advocates are likely to be competing with ways of thinking about the topic that work against their goals, yet feel like common sense to many:
- The government is inefficient, beset by bickering, made up of self-interested politicians, etc.
- Poor people are largely responsible for their own fate – didn’t the rest of us work hard to earn what we’ve got?
- Regulations make it harder for businesses to prosper.
To compete in a terrain populated with strong and stubborn “common sense” ideas like these, a new organizing idea must have the qualities that make it also sound like common sense: It must be clear and concrete, easy to remember and talk about, and must reflect how the world really works (as opposed to wishful thinking or ideological proselytizing).","How would adopting a ""ripple effects"" approach to framing the impact of budget cuts on public schools, where the focus is on the long-term consequences for students, communities, and society as a whole, influence public opinion and policy decisions related to education funding?","The adoption of a ""ripple effects"" approach to framing the impact of budget cuts on public schools can influence public opinion and policy decisions related to education funding by creating a more nuanced understanding of the long-term consequences for students, communities, and society as a whole. This approach can help policymakers and the general public understand the interconnectedness of budget cuts and their effects on various aspects of education, including student achievement, teacher morale, and community engagement.

By highlighting the ripple effects of budget cuts, advocates for education funding can demonstrate the potential long-term consequences of these cuts, such as decreased student achievement, increased teacher turnover, and reduced community involvement in schools. This can help to build a stronger case for increased funding and support for public education.

Additionally, the ripple effects approach can help to shift the focus from short-term budgetary concerns to the long-term benefits of investing in education. By emphasizing the potential long-term consequences of budget cuts, advocates can encourage policymakers to prioritize education funding and make more informed decisions about budget allocations.

In terms of specific strategies for influencing public opinion and policy decisions, the ripple effects approach can be used in conjunction with other tactics, such as:

1. Public awareness campaigns: Using social media, print and online advertising, and other forms of media to raise awareness about the potential long-term consequences of budget cuts on public education.
2. Community engagement: Organizing community events, town halls, and other forms of engagement to educate the public about the ripple effects of budget cuts and build support for increased funding.
3. Policy briefs and reports: Producing policy briefs and reports that provide data and analysis on the potential long-term consequences of budget cuts and the benefits of increased funding.
4. Testimony and advocacy: Providing testimony and advocating for increased funding for public education at the local, state, and federal levels.
5. Partnerships and collaborations: Building partnerships and collaborations with other organizations, advocacy groups, and stakeholders to amplify the message and build a stronger case for increased funding.

By using a combination of these strategies, advocates for education funding can effectively use the ripple effects approach to influence public opinion and policy decisions related to education funding.","['https://www.chalkbeat.org/newyork/2024/03/21/after-school-cuts-to-compass-explore-and-sonyc-due-to-eric-adams-budget-cuts/', 'https://www.fox17online.com/news/local-news/budget-cuts-creating-ripple-effects-with-ottawa-county-food-programs', 'https://www.cbpp.org/research/funding-down-tuition-up', 'https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/librarians-say-a-missouri-house-proposal-to-eliminate-library-funding-would-have-devastating-ripple-effects', 'https://www.theurbanist.org/2023/11/21/op-ed-seattle-poised-to-repeat-chicagos-school-closure-mistake/', 'https://www.winchesterstar.com/winchester_star/open-forum-the-ripple-effect-of-slashing-schools-budget/article_70a57c5a-76ba-5201-8743-6896a1344e13.html', 'https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/education/2023/02/09/443267/heres-everything-you-need-to-know-about-school-vouchers-in-texas/', 'https://www.mdeconomy.org/recession-budget-cuts/', 'https://ucop.edu/institutional-research-academic-planning/_files/beyond-economic-impact-regents-item.pdf', 'https://www.inquirer.com/news/philadelphia-school-district-admissions-changes-walkout-student-protest-sla-beeber-20230328.html', 'https://www.educationnext.org/costs-cutting-school-spending-lessons-from-great-recession/', 'https://www.cbpp.org/research/a-punishing-decade-for-school-funding', 'https://www.americanprogress.org/article/quality-approach-school-funding/', 'https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2020/dec/short-term-cuts-medicaid-long-term-harm', 'https://www.chalkbeat.org/detroit/2023/5/22/23727744/detroit-public-schools-staffing-cuts-paraeducators-college-advisors-culture-faciltators/', 'https://comptroller.nyc.gov/newsroom/comptroller-analysis-reviews-mayors-preliminary-budget-impacts-to-city-services/', 'https://www.waldenu.edu/online-masters-programs/ms-in-education/resource/how-budget-cuts-impact-schools', 'https://learningpolicyinstitute.org/blog/impact-covid-19-recession-teaching-positions', 'https://www.theurbanist.org/2023/10/11/seattle-public-schools-unveil-plans-for-sweeping-cuts-and-lasting-austerity/', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/28/fact-sheet-the-american-families-plan/', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4974059/', 'https://www.uscourts.gov/educational-resources/educational-activities/history-brown-v-board-education-re-enactment', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8600587/', 'https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2016/10/04/the-politics-of-climate/', 'https://ejpr.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1475-6765.12298', 'https://www.jstor.org/stable/3219881', 'https://education.msu.edu/EPC/library/documents/WP23Jacobsen-Saultz-2011-Who-Controls-Education.pdf', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0176268017301532', 'https://www.fppc.ca.gov/learn/conflicts-of-interest-rules.html', 'https://education.cfr.org/learn/reading/how-do-forces-outside-government-influence-policymaking']",politics

"Even a seemingly non-contentious issue like the arts can be undermined by problematic organizing ideas.
Strong default organizing idea: Arts as entertainment – people may have strong and positive feelings about the arts, while seeing them through the lens of personal entertainment. In this view, entertainment is a “luxury,” and the “market” will determine which arts offerings survive, based on people’s tastes as consumers of entertainment. Consequently, public support for the arts makes little sense, particularly when public funds are scarce.
More constructive organizing idea: The arts create ripple effects of benefits, such as vibrant, thriving neighborhoods where we all want to live and work. This is not only compelling, but it also sets an expectation for public responsibility for the arts.
A number of leading experts and public officials of both political parties advocate for a nuclear-free world. However, the public is largely unconvinced so far.
Strong default organizing idea: Nukes keep us safe – Nuclear weapons are often viewed as simply our most destructive weapon, therefore our biggest and best tool for self-protection, essentially a shield. In this frame, disarmament sounds like we are voluntarily giving up our security, or (“cutting off our arm” as the cartoon at right suggests) and advocates sound naïvely idealistic at best.
More constructive organizing idea: Nukes create risk in today’s world, rather than reduce it – Nuclear weapons are a liability, because they don’t help with current risks. You can’t nuke terrorists, but terrorists could get their hands on nukes. And the sheer volume means there is a lot of opportunity for accident or theft, leading to destruction that affects us all. In this view, nukes (including our own) are like a ticking bomb in the basement.
In all these cases, shifting to a new organizing idea means arriving at new conclusions about important questions such as:
- Who are the relevant players?
- What’s at stake?
- What solutions make sense?
Leading vs. Following
Unfortunately, effective communication often isn’t as simple as helping people shift to a different, familiar perspective. It can be very hard work developing and promoting what is essentially a new organizing idea – and it often means moving outside an organization’s comfort zone.
In an important sense, much advocacy is currently defensive – working within Americans’ existing, default understandings. For instance, advocates may feel obligated to sound “tough” on security or immigration – even if these stances don’t fit the policies they promote – or to avoid discussing unpopular or complicated positions (such as nuclear disarmament or carbon limits). And strategists often reinforce this instinct by viewing public opinion as a constraint on discourse – politicians either “can” or “can’t” take certain positions based on the popular views measured in surveys, for instance.
But real change often isn’t possible unless advocates make an effective case for a position that is currently unpopular or poorly understood. While daunting, it is critical to go on the offense and work to fundamentally reshape how people think about an issue. An effective organizing idea should not only “win” in the short-term, but also set the right dynamic in motion for long-term policy.
For example, a focus on the physical and organizational “public structures” that underlie American prosperity creates the foundation for a new kind of conversation. It helps people recognize the value and importance of the public sector, and helps them transcend knee-jerk dismissal of government.
Of course, identifying organizing ideas with this potential is usually not easy. But developing them can make the difference between creating the space for real change, and simply making the best of what we perceive as unfortunate limits on progress.
“New Common Sense”
To be truly effective, an organizing idea must strike people as common sense when they hear it.
In nearly every issue area, advocates are likely to be competing with ways of thinking about the topic that work against their goals, yet feel like common sense to many:
- The government is inefficient, beset by bickering, made up of self-interested politicians, etc.
- Poor people are largely responsible for their own fate – didn’t the rest of us work hard to earn what we’ve got?

Main article: Elections in Kenya","What would be the implications on constitutional governance in Kenya if the National Assembly were to pass a bill that codifies the President's ceremonial functions, removing the need for the President to perform certain symbolic duties?","The implications of codifying the President's ceremonial functions in Kenya's National Assembly would be far-reaching and multifaceted. On one hand, it could lead to a more streamlined and efficient use of the President's time, as they would no longer be burdened with ceremonial duties that could be delegated to others. This could potentially allow the President to focus more on their core responsibilities, such as governance and policy-making.

On the other hand, codifying the President's ceremonial functions could also have unintended consequences. For example, it could lead to a loss of symbolic significance and connection to the people, as the President's ceremonial duties are often seen as a way to connect with the public and demonstrate their commitment to the country. Additionally, it could also lead to a loss of tradition and cultural heritage, as ceremonial functions are often deeply rooted in a country's history and culture.

Furthermore, the codification of the President's ceremonial functions could also have implications for the role of the President in the country's constitutional governance. For example, it could potentially lead to a shift in the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches, as the President's ceremonial duties are no longer seen as a key part of their role.

In conclusion, the implications of codifying the President's ceremonial functions in Kenya's National Assembly would depend on a variety of factors, including the specific provisions of the bill and the cultural and historical context in which it is implemented.","['https://www.accc.gov.au/system/files/ACCC+commissioned+report+-+The+impact+of+digital+platforms+on+news+and+journalistic+content,+Centre+for+Media+Transition+(2).pdf', 'https://presidentialtransition.org/reports-publications/presidential-transition-act-summary/', 'https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetailsIII.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=XXI-6&chapter=21&Temp=mtdsg3&clang=_en', 'https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/imf-and-covid19/Policy-Responses-to-COVID-19', 'https://www.congress.gov/help/learn-about-the-legislative-process/enactment-of-a-law', 'https://www.ifes.org/', 'https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2017/10/03/many-countries-favor-specific-religions-officially-or-unofficially/', 'https://www.unodc.org/documents/justice-and-prison-reform/Child-Victims/Handbook_on_Children_Recruited_and_Exploited_by_Terrorist_and_Violent_Extremist_Groups_the_Role_of_the_Justice_System.E.pdf', 'https://history.defense.gov/Portals/70/Documents/pentagon/Pentagon9-11.pdf', 'https://www.state.gov/reports/2023-trafficking-in-persons-report/', 'https://www.accc.gov.au/system/files/ACCC+commissioned+report+-+The+impact+of+digital+platforms+on+news+and+journalistic+content,+Centre+for+Media+Transition+(2).pdf', 'https://presidentialtransition.org/reports-publications/presidential-transition-act-summary/', 'https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetailsIII.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=XXI-6&chapter=21&Temp=mtdsg3&clang=_en', 'https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/imf-and-covid19/Policy-Responses-to-COVID-19', 'https://www.congress.gov/help/learn-about-the-legislative-process/enactment-of-a-law', 'https://www.ifes.org/', 'https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2017/10/03/many-countries-favor-specific-religions-officially-or-unofficially/', 'https://www.unodc.org/documents/justice-and-prison-reform/Child-Victims/Handbook_on_Children_Recruited_and_Exploited_by_Terrorist_and_Violent_Extremist_Groups_the_Role_of_the_Justice_System.E.pdf', 'https://history.defense.gov/Portals/70/Documents/pentagon/Pentagon9-11.pdf', 'https://www.state.gov/reports/2023-trafficking-in-persons-report/', 'https://www.accc.gov.au/system/files/ACCC+commissioned+report+-+The+impact+of+digital+platforms+on+news+and+journalistic+content,+Centre+for+Media+Transition+(2).pdf', 'https://presidentialtransition.org/reports-publications/presidential-transition-act-summary/', 'https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetailsIII.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=XXI-6&chapter=21&Temp=mtdsg3&clang=_en', 'https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/imf-and-covid19/Policy-Responses-to-COVID-19', 'https://www.congress.gov/help/learn-about-the-legislative-process/enactment-of-a-law', 'https://www.ifes.org/', 'https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2017/10/03/many-countries-favor-specific-religions-officially-or-unofficially/', 'https://www.unodc.org/documents/justice-and-prison-reform/Child-Victims/Handbook_on_Children_Recruited_and_Exploited_by_Terrorist_and_Violent_Extremist_Groups_the_Role_of_the_Justice_System.E.pdf', 'https://history.defense.gov/Portals/70/Documents/pentagon/Pentagon9-11.pdf', 'https://www.state.gov/reports/2023-trafficking-in-persons-report/']",politics

"No matter where we are in the world, we change the dynamics of power when we use the Internet for political ends. Take a familiar case: the way community organizers used new technologies in Barack Obama’s 2008 election bid, which helped his cause and established a benchmark for other campaigns. In Kenya, the fact that bloggers are reporting publicly on debates in parliament for all the world to see gives politicians reason for pause before they speak and take action. In Switzerland and other advanced democracies, new technologies establish an important space for experimentation in public decision making. Each of these is a good thing.
We know, too, that the Internet is used as effectively by states as it is by activists, though often not in the interest of democratization. The Turkish government alters the political discourse when its censors tell the country’s Internet service providers to block all access to YouTube–which is widely popular there, as it is in the United States–because a video critical of Atatürk, the country’s modern founding father, popped up somewhere on the site.
The power of the Net is not lost on dictators or military juntas. The Internet is an extraordinary way to snoop on conversations and to look at documents sitting on hard drives in virtually every connected state in the world–as the recent exposure of a vast online spy network, centered in China, made plain.
It is not altogether clear, from the data we have, whether the Internet is a boon to the spread of democracy or its bane. The answer depends greatly on whether you are asking the question from an advanced democracy, from a state in transition, or from a country firmly under authoritarian control.
From the perch of a stable, prosperous state, the Internet is mostly a constructive force. True, we have hard problems to tackle, like how much surveillance we are willing to live with in the name of law enforcement and national security. And we ought to focus on ensuring that our kids, growing up in a digital era, are encouraged to use the Internet in safe, creative ways. But by and large, the Internet provides opportunities to improve our democracies and our economies.
In less democratic societies, sophisticated use of the Internet is limited to the few and the elite. Too often, using these tools puts activists at risk of greater control by the state, through surveillance, censorship, and imprisonment. Political leaders in dozens of states around the world are using digital tools to extend the reach of their power through propaganda, fear, and self-censorship. Resistance is limited to an impassioned, but widely dispersed, community of Internet activists. Bottom-up resistance plainly works at the margins: the tech-savvy can elude most censorship and surveillance most of the time (see “Dissent Made Safer,” p. 60). But so too can the smartest of tyrants keep the bulk of their citizens under greater, not lesser, control.
Digital technologies do not have a nature. They are what we make them. For those who care about human rights and the spread of democracy, alarm bells should be going off right now. The Internet may not be the universally positive influence we’ve been hoping for.

On one hand, online echo chambers can exacerbate existing social and political divisions, leading to decreased trust in institutions. This is because individuals are exposed to information that confirms their existing beliefs and biases, rather than being exposed to diverse perspectives and information. This can lead to a lack of trust in institutions, as individuals may perceive them as being out of touch with their needs and concerns.

On the other hand, online echo chambers can also provide a sense of community and belonging for individuals who may feel marginalized or excluded from mainstream society. This can lead to increased trust in institutions, as individuals may feel that they have a voice and are being heard.

In countries with low internet penetration, the effects of online echo chambers may be more pronounced, as individuals may have limited access to diverse sources of information and may be more reliant on online echo chambers for their news and information. This can lead to a lack of trust in institutions, as individuals may be exposed to misinformation and propaganda.

In conclusion, the effects of online echo chambers on trust in institutions in low internet penetration countries are complex and multifaceted. While online echo chambers can exacerbate existing social and political divisions, they can also provide a sense of community and belonging for individuals who may feel marginalized or excluded from mainstream society.","['https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/echo-chambers-filter-bubbles-and-polarisation-literature-review', 'https://academic.oup.com/poq/article/87/3/749/7236831', 'https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2017/10/19/the-future-of-truth-and-misinformation-online/', 'https://www.accc.gov.au/system/files/ACCC+commissioned+report+-+The+impact+of+digital+platforms+on+news+and+journalistic+content,+Centre+for+Media+Transition+(2).pdf', 'https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2056305120913993', 'https://carnegieendowment.org/2023/09/05/polarization-democracy-and-political-violence-in-united-states-what-research-says-pub-90457', 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21515581.2022.2026781', 'https://www.mpg.de/19475420/1108-bild-how-dangerous-is-digital-media-for-democracy-149835-x', 'https://www.nature.com/articles/s44159-021-00006-y', 'https://www.mpg.de/21966447/F002_Focus_028-033.pdf', 'https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/echo-chambers-filter-bubbles-and-polarisation-literature-review', 'https://academic.oup.com/poq/article/87/3/749/7236831', 'https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2017/10/19/the-future-of-truth-and-misinformation-online/', 'https://www.accc.gov.au/system/files/ACCC+commissioned+report+-+The+impact+of+digital+platforms+on+news+and+journalistic+content,+Centre+for+Media+Transition+(2).pdf', 'https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2056305120913993', 'https://carnegieendowment.org/2023/09/05/polarization-democracy-and-political-violence-in-united-states-what-research-says-pub-90457', 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21515581.2022.2026781', 'https://www.mpg.de/19475420/1108-bild-how-dangerous-is-digital-media-for-democracy-149835-x', 'https://www.nature.com/articles/s44159-021-00006-y', 'https://www.mpg.de/21966447/F002_Focus_028-033.pdf']",politics

To achieve this, international organizations can adopt strategies that address the potential drawbacks of digital technologies, such as the widening digital divide, the risk of perpetuating existing power imbalances and inequalities, and the need to ensure that digital technologies are used in a way that respects the needs and concerns of all stakeholders.

Some of the ways to mitigate the risks of digital technologies in international development include:

* Ensuring that digital technologies are designed and implemented in a way that is inclusive and equitable, and that they do not exacerbate existing social and economic inequalities.
* Providing access to digital technologies and digital literacy training to marginalized and underrepresented groups, in order to reduce the digital divide and promote greater equality.
* Implementing policies and regulations that promote transparency, accountability, and fairness in the development and use of digital technologies.
* Encouraging the involvement of private sector actors in the development and use of digital technologies, while ensuring that their involvement does not exacerbate existing inequalities.
* Developing and implementing digital technologies that are designed to address specific development challenges, such as poverty, inequality, and climate change.

To ensure that digital technologies do not perpetuate existing power imbalances and inequalities, international organizations can adopt strategies that address the root causes of these imbalances, such as:

* Addressing structural gender inequalities and power imbalances, and promoting greater gender equality and inclusion in the development and use of digital technologies.
* Promoting greater diversity and inclusion in the development and use of digital technologies, and ensuring that marginalized and underrepresented groups have a voice in the development and use of these technologies.
* Implementing policies and regulations that promote transparency, accountability, and fairness in the development and use of digital technologies, and that ensure that the benefits of these technologies are shared equitably.

Overall, the use of digital technologies by international organizations, such as the United Nations, has the potential to promote sustainable development and reduce global poverty, while ensuring that these efforts do not perpetuate existing power imbalances and inequalities. However, it is essential that these efforts are designed and implemented in a way that is inclusive, equitable, and transparent, and that they address the root causes of these imbalances.","['https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/01/governments-leverage-4ir-achieve-sdgs/', 'https://www.undp.org/blog/three-ways-digital-transformation-accelerates-sustainable-and-inclusive-development', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/international-business-review/about/call-for-papers', 'https://www.bcg.com/publications/2021/how-technology-helps-sustainability-initiatives', 'https://press.un.org/en/2023/gaef3587.doc.htm', 'https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/how-innovative-companies-leverage-tech-to-outperform', 'https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/documents/gs4dhdaa2a9f352b0445bafbc79ca799dce4d.pdf', 'https://www.csis.org/analysis/innovative-data-collection-methods-international-development', 'https://unstats.un.org/bigdata/', 'https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/how-digital-technology-and-innovation-can-help-protect-planet', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/', 'https://www.csis.org/analysis/preparing-international-development-professionals-digital-age', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/03/09/executive-order-on-ensuring-responsible-development-of-digital-assets/', 'https://www.qeh.ox.ac.uk/blog/how-digital-technologies-are-transforming-refugees-experiences', 'https://www.digitaldevforum.com/about', 'http://international-review.icrc.org/articles/digital-technologies-humanitarian-law-policy-action-913', 'https://www.un.org/en/sg-digital-cooperation-panel', 'https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/08/28/new-tech-new-threats-and-new-governance-challenges-opportunity-to-craft-smarter-responses-pub-79736', 'https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/documents/gs4dhdaa2a9f352b0445bafbc79ca799dce4d.pdf', 'https://www.ictworks.org/session-ideas-gddf-2024/', 'https://www.brookings.edu/articles/algorithmic-bias-detection-and-mitigation-best-practices-and-policies-to-reduce-consumer-harms/', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7973804/', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/National-Strategy-on-Gender-Equity-and-Equality.pdf', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9931338/', 'https://www.aclu.org/news/privacy-technology/how-artificial-intelligence-can-deepen-racial-and-economic-inequities', 'https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-023-02079-x', 'https://www.researchgate.net/publication/378704510_Digital_Inequality_Examining_the_unequal_access_to_digital_technologies_and_the_resulting_disparities_in_opportunities_resources_and_information', 'https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/10/why-we-must-consider-the-intergenerational-impact-of-ai/', 'https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2020/634452/EPRS_STU(2020)634452_EN.pdf', 'https://one.oecd.org/document/EDU/WKP(2023)14/en/pdf']",politics

Bottom-up resistance plainly works at the margins: the tech-savvy can elude most censorship and surveillance most of the time (see “Dissent Made Safer,” p. 60). But so too can the smartest of tyrants keep the bulk of their citizens under greater, not lesser, control.
Digital technologies do not have a nature. They are what we make them. For those who care about human rights and the spread of democracy, alarm bells should be going off right now. The Internet may not be the universally positive influence we’ve been hoping for.

"Remembering Benazir Bhutto
What were murdered political leader Benazir Bhutto’s views on Pakistan?
December 27, 2007
Back in 1988, Benazir Bhutto made history by becoming Pakistan’s prime minister — making her the first woman leader of a Muslim country in modern times. After an eight-year voluntary exile, the leader of Pakistan’s popular opposition party returned to the country in mid-October 2007 — and was assassinated on December 27. We present Ms. Bhutto’s views on the future of Pakistan, a country on the faultline of major global challenges.
Why did you reengage in your country’s politics?
“There are moments in history that prove decisive and mark a turning point for the future. The U.S. Civil War was such a moment in the United States. The fall of the Berlin Wall was such a moment for Germany and the European Union. Today is Pakistan’s moment of truth.”
Why does Pakistan matter so much in a global context?
“We confront two great polarities in Pakistan today — the battle between democracy and dictatorship, and the fight for the hearts and souls of the people manifest in the battle between moderation and extremism.”
How concerned are you that extremists will take over Pakistan?
“Mr. Musharraf’s dictatorship is fueling instability in Pakistan. Oppressed citizens, who are denied a truly representative government that can address their most basic issues, now seek refuge in extremism and religion fundamentalism.”
Is Musharraf at the root of Pakistan’s problem?
“General Musharraf is sincere, but there are some vested interests who do not want to see a peaceful transition from military rule to democracy.”
Was a political crisis in the offing?
“It is up to the government to decide whether it wants a peaceful transition to democracy through free and fair elections — or face people’s power and a Ukrainian-style Orange Revolution in Pakistan.”
So what’s the way out?
“Unless the people of Pakistan are empowered through the ballot, extremists will continue to exploit the discontent to their advantage.”
How important is democracy in all this?
“The restoration of democracy is only the first step. I would like to see the international community make a long-term commitment to a country as critical as Pakistan — and indeed our nearby neighbor, Afghanistan, in helping us to build our institutions.”
Are there parallels to Europe — and how it was supported for several decades in the 20th century?
“When Europe was driven by war, the international community put NATO troops into Europe — and it made a long-term commitment through the Marshall Plan to develop the institutions.”
Won’t the buoyant Pakistani economy support these efforts?
“On paper, the economic statistics look good because you’ve got the external flows coming in. But in fact, poverty and unemployment in Pakistan has risen, and it’s ticking like a time bomb.”
What is unique about your political journey?
“I have led an unusual life. I have buried a father killed at age 50 and two brothers killed in the prime of their lives. I raised my children as a single mother when my husband was arrested and held for eight years without a conviction — a hostage to my political career. I made my choice when the mantle of political leadership was thrust upon my shoulders after my father’s murder. I did not shrink from responsibility then, and I will not shrink from it now.”
And finally, what would you have done differently from the last time you held office?
“The people wanted me to be there as a woman leader, somebody who was more nurturing, who could take care of our people, our women, our children, redress their needs, build them hostels and schools and provide them with basic nutrition. I wish I had focused more on that than on the more militaristic notions.”","How would you describe the extent to which Pakistan's military has been involved in the country's internal affairs under General Musharraf's rule, and what are the implications of this involvement for the country's politics and stability?","The extent of Pakistan's military involvement under General Musharraf's rule was significant, with the military playing a dominant role in the country's politics and governance.","['https://carnegieendowment.org/posts/2003/07/pakistans-endgame-in-kashmir', 'https://www.brookings.edu/articles/why-pakistans-former-ruler-musharraf-was-sentenced-to-death-and-what-it-means/', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pervez_Musharraf', 'https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/30/can-pakistans-politicians-break-the-militarys-stranglehold', 'https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2008/country-chapters/pakistan', 'https://academicworks.cuny.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4274&context=gc_etds', 'https://www.hrw.org/news/2013/03/23/pakistan-hold-musharraf-accountable-abuses', 'https://www.jstor.org/stable/4330001', 'https://ndupress.ndu.edu/Media/News/News-Article-View/Article/2498234/the-battle-for-pakistan-the-bitter-us-friendship-and-a-tough-neighbourhood/', 'https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-64528348', 'https://carnegieendowment.org/posts/2003/07/pakistans-endgame-in-kashmir', 'https://www.brookings.edu/articles/why-pakistans-former-ruler-musharraf-was-sentenced-to-death-and-what-it-means/', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pervez_Musharraf', 'https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/30/can-pakistans-politicians-break-the-militarys-stranglehold', 'https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2008/country-chapters/pakistan', 'https://academicworks.cuny.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4274&context=gc_etds', 'https://www.hrw.org/news/2013/03/23/pakistan-hold-musharraf-accountable-abuses', 'https://www.jstor.org/stable/4330001', 'https://ndupress.ndu.edu/Media/News/News-Article-View/Article/2498234/the-battle-for-pakistan-the-bitter-us-friendship-and-a-tough-neighbourhood/', 'https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-64528348', 'https://carnegieendowment.org/posts/2003/07/pakistans-endgame-in-kashmir', 'https://www.brookings.edu/articles/why-pakistans-former-ruler-musharraf-was-sentenced-to-death-and-what-it-means/', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pervez_Musharraf', 'https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/30/can-pakistans-politicians-break-the-militarys-stranglehold', 'https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2008/country-chapters/pakistan', 'https://academicworks.cuny.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4274&context=gc_etds', 'https://www.hrw.org/news/2013/03/23/pakistan-hold-musharraf-accountable-abuses', 'https://www.jstor.org/stable/4330001', 'https://ndupress.ndu.edu/Media/News/News-Article-View/Article/2498234/the-battle-for-pakistan-the-bitter-us-friendship-and-a-tough-neighbourhood/', 'https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-64528348']",politics

"Remembering Benazir Bhutto
What were murdered political leader Benazir Bhutto’s views on Pakistan?
December 27, 2007
Back in 1988, Benazir Bhutto made history by becoming Pakistan’s prime minister — making her the first woman leader of a Muslim country in modern times. After an eight-year voluntary exile, the leader of Pakistan’s popular opposition party returned to the country in mid-October 2007 — and was assassinated on December 27. We present Ms. Bhutto’s views on the future of Pakistan, a country on the faultline of major global challenges.
Why did you reengage in your country’s politics?
“There are moments in history that prove decisive and mark a turning point for the future. The U.S. Civil War was such a moment in the United States. The fall of the Berlin Wall was such a moment for Germany and the European Union. Today is Pakistan’s moment of truth.”
Why does Pakistan matter so much in a global context?
“We confront two great polarities in Pakistan today — the battle between democracy and dictatorship, and the fight for the hearts and souls of the people manifest in the battle between moderation and extremism.”
How concerned are you that extremists will take over Pakistan?
“Mr. Musharraf’s dictatorship is fueling instability in Pakistan. Oppressed citizens, who are denied a truly representative government that can address their most basic issues, now seek refuge in extremism and religion fundamentalism.”
Is Musharraf at the root of Pakistan’s problem?
“General Musharraf is sincere, but there are some vested interests who do not want to see a peaceful transition from military rule to democracy.”
Was a political crisis in the offing?
“It is up to the government to decide whether it wants a peaceful transition to democracy through free and fair elections — or face people’s power and a Ukrainian-style Orange Revolution in Pakistan.”
So what’s the way out?
“Unless the people of Pakistan are empowered through the ballot, extremists will continue to exploit the discontent to their advantage.”
How important is democracy in all this?
“The restoration of democracy is only the first step. I would like to see the international community make a long-term commitment to a country as critical as Pakistan — and indeed our nearby neighbor, Afghanistan, in helping us to build our institutions.”
Are there parallels to Europe — and how it was supported for several decades in the 20th century?
“When Europe was driven by war, the international community put NATO troops into Europe — and it made a long-term commitment through the Marshall Plan to develop the institutions.”
Won’t the buoyant Pakistani economy support these efforts?
“On paper, the economic statistics look good because you’ve got the external flows coming in. But in fact, poverty and unemployment in Pakistan has risen, and it’s ticking like a time bomb.”
What is unique about your political journey?
“I have led an unusual life. I have buried a father killed at age 50 and two brothers killed in the prime of their lives. I raised my children as a single mother when my husband was arrested and held for eight years without a conviction — a hostage to my political career. I made my choice when the mantle of political leadership was thrust upon my shoulders after my father’s murder. I did not shrink from responsibility then, and I will not shrink from it now.”
And finally, what would you have done differently from the last time you held office?
“The people wanted me to be there as a woman leader, somebody who was more nurturing, who could take care of our people, our women, our children, redress their needs, build them hostels and schools and provide them with basic nutrition. I wish I had focused more on that than on the more militaristic notions.”","How would you describe the relationship between the political parties and the media in a country that is transitioning from military rule to democracy, and what role do you think they can play in preventing a power vacuum?","The relationship between political parties and the media in a country transitioning from military rule to democracy is complex and multifaceted. The media plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion, holding those in power accountable, and facilitating the transition to democracy. Political parties, on the other hand, play a key role in democratic processes, ensuring participation in political life, the expression of the will of the people, and the representation of diverse interests.","['https://2017-2020.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2496/200sbc.pdf', 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10584609.2023.2238652', 'https://www.accc.gov.au/system/files/ACCC+commissioned+report+-+The+impact+of+digital+platforms+on+news+and+journalistic+content,+Centre+for+Media+Transition+(2).pdf', 'https://www.wilsoncenter.org/blog-post/social-media-and-democratic-transitions-kenya-double-edged-sword', 'https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/after-the-arab-spring-how-the-media-trashed-the-transitions/', 'https://www.stimson.org/2022/disinformation-and-democratic-transition-a-kenyan-case-study/', 'https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2017-11/Media%20and%20Democratisation.pdf', 'https://www.routledge.com/Media-and-Democratic-Transition-in-South-Korea/Kwak/p/book/9781138816695', 'https://carnegieendowment.org/2016/10/07/how-social-media-undermined-egypt-s-democratic-transition-pub-64830', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7330882/', 'https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/tunisia-political-parties-and-democracy-crisis', 'https://www.jstor.org/stable/48602367', 'https://carnegieendowment.org/2020/03/24/breaking-cycle-of-gender-exclusion-in-political-party-development-pub-81345', 'https://www.u4.no/publications/the-role-of-political-party-finance-reform-in-the-transition-from-dominant-to-competitive-party-systems', 'https://carnegieendowment.org/2016/09/14/democracy-support-strategies-leading-with-women-s-political-empowerment-pub-64534', 'https://www.iemed.org/publication/the-role-of-political-islam-in-arab-transitions-year-ii-of-the-arab-spring-between-islamism-democratic-transition-and-new-power-relations/', 'https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-east-asian-studies/article/social-networks-as-a-political-resource-revisiting-the-korean-democratic-transition/7B2C639FCCFB36BCA6C5E61DC2BAFA46', 'https://www.chathamhouse.org/2023/11/democracy-ukraine', 'https://www.lamoncloa.gob.es/lang/en/espana/historyandculture/history/Paginas/index.aspx', 'https://ceupress.com/book/rolling-transition-and-role-intellectuals']",politics
"This issue of Insight Turkey comes with a different format and brings to its readers two different topics that require special attention when we consider the latest regional and global affairs. The planned topic was Central Asia; however, the early presidential and parliamentarian elections in Turkey led us to cover a second topic in the issue. First, the current issue focuses on a forgotten but very important region of Central Asia. The second section of the journal comprises commentaries and articles on the latest elections in Turkey, how to understand them and what could be the future of the presidential system.
Central Asia is one of the most geostrategic and penetrated regions in the world. The founding father of geopolitics, the British geographer Sir Halford John Mackinder, considers Central Asia as a part of the “heartland.” The control of Central Asia, a region stretching from the Caspian Sea in the west to China in the east, is a precondition of the world hegemony. Throughout the 20thcentury, the Central Asian countries were under the rule of the Soviet Union. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the republics of Central Asia re-emerged as independent actors of international politics. Later, they were declared as “near abroad” by Russia; that is, they were kept close to Russia through several multilateral platforms.
Nowadays, Central Asian countries, namely Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan, face many challenges such as underdevelopment, poor governance and corruption, mutual mistrust between neighbors, fear of radicalism, and threats from neighboring global powers. The governments of the regional countries must work together in order to be able to overcome these challenges. They need to increase intra-regional trade and to de-securitize their relations with other countries.
Central Asian countries are squeezed between two heavyweight powers, Russia and China. With the revitalization of the historical Silk Road by China, many observers began to discuss the increasing importance and role of the Central Asian countries. Central Asia will be the main ground for intra-East regional and global competition. The mostly Turkic and Muslim countries can play the role of game changers at least, between the two global actors.
Turkey, a country which shares the same language, history and culture with the Central Asian countries, is also one of the effective actors in the region. After an unprepared and unsuccessful attempt to forge links, in the wake of their independence in the 1990s, Turkey has improved its relations with the Turkic states and now has multi-dimensional relations (economic, cultural, political, and security) with these countries.
The transformation of the Turkish political system into a presidential one, after the April 16, 2017 referendum, was finalized with the June 24, 2018 elections, when Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was elected as the first Turkish president in the context of the new presidential system. Naturally, many questions have risen in terms of the transformation of the new system and its impact on Turkey’s foreign policy. This issue of Insight Turkey aims to discuss this political transformation.
Turkey has been governed by a multi-party parliamentarian system for decades. The country has experienced several chaotic periods due to political instabilities, mainly as a result of coalition or weak governments. Since Turkey could not end the bureaucratic (especially military and judiciary) tutelage, it could not consolidate its democracy under the parliamentarian system. Therefore, many politicians such as Necmettin Erbakan and Süleyman Demirel asked for the transformation of the system into a presidential one. At a time when the whole world has been experiencing a transformation, Turkey has also decided to consolidate its political authority; and therefore, it has decided to transform its political system into a unified and strong executive power in order to be able to struggle against emerging threats. Ultimately, as a regional power and global actor, Turkey now has a strong political leadership, who plays an effective role in international politics.
In this issue, we bring four manuscripts which analyze in detail the June 2018 elections and the new presidential system in Turkey. On the verge of the reorganization process in Turkey, Zahid Sobacı, Özer Köseoğlu, and Nebi Miş in their article provide a legal and institutional analysis of how the public policy process and the roles and responsibilities of policy actors have changed with the new system.","What would be the implications of a Turkey-led mediation effort in the Eastern Mediterranean, aimed at resolving the Cyprus dispute and normalizing relations between Turkey and Greece?","The implications of a Turkey-led mediation effort in the Eastern Mediterranean are multifaceted and complex, involving various regional and global actors. The search results suggest that Turkey's leadership in mediation efforts could have both positive and negative consequences. On the one hand, Turkey's involvement could help to de-escalate tensions and promote dialogue between Greece and Cyprus, potentially leading to a more stable and peaceful region. On the other hand, Turkey's leadership could also be seen as a challenge to the existing power dynamics in the region, potentially leading to increased tensions and conflict.

The search results also highlight the importance of considering the perspectives of various regional and global actors, including the European Union, NATO, Russia, and China. The EU and NATO have already initiated mediation efforts in the region, and it is unclear how a Turkey-led effort would fit into these existing initiatives. Russia and China, meanwhile, have their own interests and agendas in the region, and their involvement could complicate the situation further.

Ultimately, the success of a Turkey-led mediation effort would depend on a range of factors, including the willingness of all parties to engage in dialogue, the ability of Turkey to balance its own interests with those of other regional and global actors, and the ability of the international community to provide support and guidance to the mediation process.","['https://www.brookings.edu/articles/turkey-europe-and-the-eastern-mediterranean-charting-a-way-out-of-the-current-deadlock/', 'https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/IDAN/2022/653662/EXPO_IDA(2022)653662_EN.pdf', 'https://www.crisisgroup.org/europe-central-asia/western-europe-mediterranean/cyprus/how-reinvigorate-uns-mediation-efforts-cyprus', 'https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/menasource/for-turkey-the-libyan-conflict-and-the-eastern-mediterranean-are-inextricably-linked/', 'https://www.crisisgroup.org/europe-central-asia/western-europemediterranean-turkiye-cyprus/how-defuse-tensions-eastern', 'https://www.iom.int/sites/g/files/tmzbdl486/files/2018-07/RS5.pdf', 'https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2021/10/russias-posture-in-the-mediterranean-implications-for-nato-and-europe?lang=en', 'https://www.swp-berlin.org/10.18449/2020C62/', 'https://carnegieendowment.org/2022/11/14/political-change-and-turkey-s-foreign-policy-pub-88387', 'https://www.nbr.org/publication/china-in-the-eastern-mediterranean/', 'https://www.brookings.edu/articles/turkey-europe-and-the-eastern-mediterranean-charting-a-way-out-of-the-current-deadlock/', 'https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/IDAN/2022/653662/EXPO_IDA(2022)653662_EN.pdf', 'https://www.crisisgroup.org/europe-central-asia/western-europe-mediterranean/cyprus/how-reinvigorate-uns-mediation-efforts-cyprus', 'https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/menasource/for-turkey-the-libyan-conflict-and-the-eastern-mediterranean-are-inextricably-linked/', 'https://www.crisisgroup.org/europe-central-asia/western-europemediterranean-turkiye-cyprus/how-defuse-tensions-eastern', 'https://www.iom.int/sites/g/files/tmzbdl486/files/2018-07/RS5.pdf', 'https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2021/10/russias-posture-in-the-mediterranean-implications-for-nato-and-europe?lang=en', 'https://www.swp-berlin.org/10.18449/2020C62/', 'https://carnegieendowment.org/2022/11/14/political-change-and-turkey-s-foreign-policy-pub-88387', 'https://www.nbr.org/publication/china-in-the-eastern-mediterranean/', 'https://www.brookings.edu/articles/turkey-europe-and-the-eastern-mediterranean-charting-a-way-out-of-the-current-deadlock/', 'https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/IDAN/2022/653662/EXPO_IDA(2022)653662_EN.pdf', 'https://www.crisisgroup.org/europe-central-asia/western-europe-mediterranean/cyprus/how-reinvigorate-uns-mediation-efforts-cyprus', 'https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/menasource/for-turkey-the-libyan-conflict-and-the-eastern-mediterranean-are-inextricably-linked/', 'https://www.crisisgroup.org/europe-central-asia/western-europemediterranean-turkiye-cyprus/how-defuse-tensions-eastern', 'https://www.iom.int/sites/g/files/tmzbdl486/files/2018-07/RS5.pdf', 'https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2021/10/russias-posture-in-the-mediterranean-implications-for-nato-and-europe?lang=en', 'https://www.swp-berlin.org/10.18449/2020C62/', 'https://carnegieendowment.org/2022/11/14/political-change-and-turkey-s-foreign-policy-pub-88387', 'https://www.nbr.org/publication/china-in-the-eastern-mediterranean/']",politics

On one hand, Turkey's cultural and linguistic influence could promote regional cooperation, economic integration, and cultural exchange, potentially strengthening regional security and stability. On the other hand, Turkey's growing influence could also lead to increased competition with other regional and global powers, potentially destabilizing the region and creating new security challenges.

Turkey's language and cultural influence in Central Asia is rooted in its historical and cultural ties with the region, which date back to the Ottoman Empire. Today, Turkey is actively promoting its language and culture in the region through various means, including education, media, and cultural exchange programs. This has led to a significant increase in the number of Turkish language speakers in the region, particularly among the younger population.

The implications of Turkey's language and cultural influence on regional security and global competition are complex and multifaceted. On one hand, Turkey's influence could promote regional cooperation and stability by fostering greater cultural understanding and exchange between Turkey and the Central Asian states. This could potentially lead to increased economic integration and cooperation, as well as greater regional security and stability.

On the other hand, Turkey's growing influence could also lead to increased competition with other regional and global powers, potentially destabilizing the region and creating new security challenges. For example, Turkey's influence could potentially lead to increased tensions with Russia, which has historically been a dominant player in the region. Similarly, Turkey's influence could also lead to increased competition with China, which is increasingly active in the region.

In conclusion, the potential implications of Turkey's language and cultural influence on the political landscape of Central Asia, particularly in the context of regional security and global competition, are complex and multifaceted. While Turkey's influence could potentially promote regional cooperation and stability, it could also lead to increased competition and potential destabilization of the region.","['https://thediplomat.com/2022/10/turkeys-growing-influence-in-central-asia/', 'https://www.biola.edu/blogs/good-book-blog/2016/a-turkic-world-connection-in-the-chronicles-of-narnia', 'https://www.quora.com/Is-Turkey-softly-taking-over-Central-Asia', 'https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/central-asia-xiv', 'https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-Central-Asia-and-Turkey', 'https://www.gisreportsonline.com/r/turkey-central-asia/', 'http://aei.pitt.edu/29783/1/SerraNationbldgCentAsiaLongJune10.pdf', 'https://www.gisreportsonline.com/r/turkic-commonwealth-asia/', 'https://en.unesco.org/silkroad/content/diary-young-explorers-languages-central-asia', 'https://www.fiia.fi/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/bp328_toni-alaranta-kristiina-silvan_turkey-in-central-asia.pdf', 'https://carnegieendowment.org/2023/08/17/russia-s-wartime-foreign-policy-regional-hegemony-in-question-pub-91107', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Biden-Harris-Administrations-National-Security-Strategy-10.2022.pdf', 'https://carnegieendowment.org/2018/02/28/cooperation-and-competition-russia-and-china-in-central-asia-russian-far-east-and-arctic-pub-75673', 'https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R47591', 'https://www.crisisgroup.org/asia/south-asia/afghanistan/afghanistans-security-challenges-under-taliban', 'https://tnsr.org/2024/08/filling-the-void-left-by-great-power-retrenchment-russia-central-asia-and-the-u-s-withdrawal-from-afghanistan/', 'https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/Newsroom/Reports%20and%20Pubs/2025_Global_Trends_Final_Report.pdf', 'https://www.crisisgroup.org/europe-central-asia/central-asia/245-central-asias-silk-road-rivalries', 'https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/JIPA/Display/Article/3212634/the-growth-of-south-korean-soft-power-and-its-geopolitical-implications/', 'https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2022/03/15/blog-how-war-in-ukraine-is-reverberating-across-worlds-regions-031522', 'https://carnegieendowment.org/2023/08/17/russia-s-wartime-foreign-policy-regional-hegemony-in-question-pub-91107', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Biden-Harris-Administrations-National-Security-Strategy-10.2022.pdf', 'https://carnegieendowment.org/2018/02/28/cooperation-and-competition-russia-and-china-in-central-asia-russian-far-east-and-arctic-pub-75673', 'https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R47591', 'https://www.crisisgroup.org/asia/south-asia/afghanistan/afghanistans-security-challenges-under-taliban', 'https://tnsr.org/2024/08/filling-the-void-left-by-great-power-retrenchment-russia-central-asia-and-the-u-s-withdrawal-from-afghanistan/', 'https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/Newsroom/Reports%20and%20Pubs/2025_Global_Trends_Final_Report.pdf', 'https://www.crisisgroup.org/europe-central-asia/central-asia/245-central-asias-silk-road-rivalries', 'https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/JIPA/Display/Article/3212634/the-growth-of-south-korean-soft-power-and-its-geopolitical-implications/', 'https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2022/03/15/blog-how-war-in-ukraine-is-reverberating-across-worlds-regions-031522']",politics

First, the current issue focuses on a forgotten but very important region of Central Asia. The second section of the journal comprises commentaries and articles on the latest elections in Turkey, how to understand them and what could be the future of the presidential system.
Central Asia is one of the most geostrategic and penetrated regions in the world. The founding father of geopolitics, the British geographer Sir Halford John Mackinder, considers Central Asia as a part of the “heartland.” The control of Central Asia, a region stretching from the Caspian Sea in the west to China in the east, is a precondition of the world hegemony. Throughout the 20thcentury, the Central Asian countries were under the rule of the Soviet Union. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the republics of Central Asia re-emerged as independent actors of international politics. Later, they were declared as “near abroad” by Russia; that is, they were kept close to Russia through several multilateral platforms.
Nowadays, Central Asian countries, namely Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan, face many challenges such as underdevelopment, poor governance and corruption, mutual mistrust between neighbors, fear of radicalism, and threats from neighboring global powers. The governments of the regional countries must work together in order to be able to overcome these challenges. They need to increase intra-regional trade and to de-securitize their relations with other countries.
Central Asian countries are squeezed between two heavyweight powers, Russia and China. With the revitalization of the historical Silk Road by China, many observers began to discuss the increasing importance and role of the Central Asian countries. Central Asia will be the main ground for intra-East regional and global competition. The mostly Turkic and Muslim countries can play the role of game changers at least, between the two global actors.
Turkey, a country which shares the same language, history and culture with the Central Asian countries, is also one of the effective actors in the region. After an unprepared and unsuccessful attempt to forge links, in the wake of their independence in the 1990s, Turkey has improved its relations with the Turkic states and now has multi-dimensional relations (economic, cultural, political, and security) with these countries.
The transformation of the Turkish political system into a presidential one, after the April 16, 2017 referendum, was finalized with the June 24, 2018 elections, when Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was elected as the first Turkish president in the context of the new presidential system. Naturally, many questions have risen in terms of the transformation of the new system and its impact on Turkey’s foreign policy. This issue of Insight Turkey aims to discuss this political transformation.
Turkey has been governed by a multi-party parliamentarian system for decades. The country has experienced several chaotic periods due to political instabilities, mainly as a result of coalition or weak governments. Since Turkey could not end the bureaucratic (especially military and judiciary) tutelage, it could not consolidate its democracy under the parliamentarian system. Therefore, many politicians such as Necmettin Erbakan and Süleyman Demirel asked for the transformation of the system into a presidential one. At a time when the whole world has been experiencing a transformation, Turkey has also decided to consolidate its political authority; and therefore, it has decided to transform its political system into a unified and strong executive power in order to be able to struggle against emerging threats. Ultimately, as a regional power and global actor, Turkey now has a strong political leadership, who plays an effective role in international politics.
In this issue, we bring four manuscripts which analyze in detail the June 2018 elections and the new presidential system in Turkey. On the verge of the reorganization process in Turkey, Zahid Sobacı, Özer Köseoğlu, and Nebi Miş in their article provide a legal and institutional analysis of how the public policy process and the roles and responsibilities of policy actors have changed with the new system.","How would a sudden decline in global oil prices affect the Turkish government's ability to implement its economic recovery plan, considering the country's reliance on foreign energy imports and its ongoing economic recovery from the impact of economic sanctions?","The sudden decline in global oil prices could have both positive and negative impacts on the Turkish government's ability to implement its economic recovery plan.

The positive impacts include:

* Reduced fuel and oil expenses, which could lead to cost savings and increased competitiveness for Turkish businesses.
* Lower energy prices could also lead to increased consumer spending and economic growth.
* The decline in oil prices could also reduce the country's trade deficit, as Turkey is a significant importer of oil.

On the other hand, the negative impacts include:

* The decline in oil prices could also lead to reduced government revenue from oil-related taxes and royalties.
* The reduced demand for oil could also lead to reduced investment in the energy sector, which could have long-term implications for the country's energy security.
* The decline in oil prices could also lead to reduced economic growth in countries that are major oil producers, which could have negative impacts on Turkey's economy through trade and investment links.

Overall, the impact of a sudden decline in global oil prices on the Turkish government's ability to implement its economic recovery plan will depend on a range of factors, including the magnitude and duration of the price decline, the country's energy mix, and the overall state of the global economy.","['https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7195973/', 'https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/turkey/overview', 'https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/oil/2000/', 'https://www.jstor.org/stable/26966911', 'https://www.swp-berlin.org/publications/products/arbeitspapiere/CATS__Working_Paper_Nr_1_2021_Cakmakli_Demiralp_Yesiltas_Yildirim.pdf', 'https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2024/02/understanding-the-energy-drivers-of-turkeys-foreign-policy?center=europe', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1303070120300020', 'https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/farm-economy/farm-sector-income-finances/farm-sector-income-forecast/', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1303070116000056', 'https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/venezuela-crisis', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7195973/', 'https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/turkey/overview', 'https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/oil/2000/', 'https://www.jstor.org/stable/26966911', 'https://www.swp-berlin.org/publications/products/arbeitspapiere/CATS__Working_Paper_Nr_1_2021_Cakmakli_Demiralp_Yesiltas_Yildirim.pdf', 'https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2024/02/understanding-the-energy-drivers-of-turkeys-foreign-policy?center=europe', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1303070120300020', 'https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/farm-economy/farm-sector-income-finances/farm-sector-income-forecast/', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1303070116000056', 'https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/venezuela-crisis', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7195973/', 'https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/turkey/overview', 'https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/oil/2000/', 'https://www.jstor.org/stable/26966911', 'https://www.swp-berlin.org/publications/products/arbeitspapiere/CATS__Working_Paper_Nr_1_2021_Cakmakli_Demiralp_Yesiltas_Yildirim.pdf', 'https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2024/02/understanding-the-energy-drivers-of-turkeys-foreign-policy?center=europe', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1303070120300020', 'https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/farm-economy/farm-sector-income-finances/farm-sector-income-forecast/', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1303070116000056', 'https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/venezuela-crisis']",politics

The pros and cons of feudalism make it difficult to say whether it is a beneficial or detrimental system of ruling. Much depended on how it was implemented and what the ethics of the nobility happened to be. Eventually people want something more valuable than land for their services and that is what causes feudalism to break down.","How did the reformation of the manorial system during the Enlightenment period affect the development of modern industrialized economies, and what were the primary factors that contributed to this transformation?","The reformation of the manorial system during the Enlightenment period had a significant impact on the development of modern industrialized economies. The Enlightenment thinkers' emphasis on reason, individual rights, and the scientific method led to the development of new economic systems, such as capitalism and mercantilism. These systems, in turn, contributed to the growth of industrialization and the emergence of modern industrialized economies.

The reformation of the manorial system, which was characterized by the decline of feudalism and the rise of capitalism, led to the development of new economic structures and institutions. The emergence of a market-based economy, where goods and services were produced and traded for profit, replaced the traditional feudal system, where goods and services were produced and distributed based on social status and obligations.

The Enlightenment thinkers' emphasis on individual rights and liberties also contributed to the development of modern industrialized economies. The idea of individual rights and liberties led to the emergence of a more mobile and flexible workforce, which was essential for the growth of industrialization. The Enlightenment thinkers' emphasis on reason and science also led to the development of new technologies and innovations, which were essential for the growth of industrialization.

In addition, the Enlightenment thinkers' emphasis on the importance of education and the development of human capital led to the emergence of a more educated and skilled workforce, which was essential for the growth of industrialization. The Enlightenment thinkers' emphasis on the importance of education and the development of human capital also led to the emergence of a more meritocratic society, where individuals were rewarded based on their skills and abilities rather than their social status.

In conclusion, the reformation of the manorial system during the Enlightenment period had a significant impact on the development of modern industrialized economies. The Enlightenment thinkers' emphasis on reason, individual rights, and the scientific method led to the development of new economic systems, such as capitalism and mercantilism, which contributed to the growth of industrialization and the emergence of modern industrialized economies.","['https://afe.easia.columbia.edu/special/japan_1750_meiji.htm', 'https://www.britannica.com/event/Meiji-Restoration', 'https://www.lamoncloa.gob.es/lang/en/espana/historyandculture/history/Paginas/index.aspx', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feudalism', 'https://www.lhschools.org/Downloads/TCI%20Chapter%205%20The%20Decline%20of%20Feudalism.pdf', 'https://www.history.com/topics/european-history/french-revolution', 'https://education.ohio.gov/getattachment/Topics/Learning-in-Ohio/Social-Studies/Ohio-s-Learning-Standards-for-Social-Studies/SSFinalStandards01019.pdf.aspx?lang=en-US', 'https://www.history.com/topics/european-history/enlightenment', 'https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/coming-to-france/france-facts/symbols-of-the-republic/article/liberty-equality-fraternity', 'https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/ap19-sg-european-history.pdf', 'https://afe.easia.columbia.edu/special/japan_1750_meiji.htm', 'https://www.britannica.com/event/Meiji-Restoration', 'https://www.lamoncloa.gob.es/lang/en/espana/historyandculture/history/Paginas/index.aspx', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feudalism', 'https://www.lhschools.org/Downloads/TCI%20Chapter%205%20The%20Decline%20of%20Feudalism.pdf', 'https://www.history.com/topics/european-history/french-revolution', 'https://education.ohio.gov/getattachment/Topics/Learning-in-Ohio/Social-Studies/Ohio-s-Learning-Standards-for-Social-Studies/SSFinalStandards01019.pdf.aspx?lang=en-US', 'https://www.history.com/topics/european-history/enlightenment', 'https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/coming-to-france/france-facts/symbols-of-the-republic/article/liberty-equality-fraternity', 'https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/ap19-sg-european-history.pdf', 'https://afe.easia.columbia.edu/special/japan_1750_meiji.htm', 'https://www.britannica.com/event/Meiji-Restoration', 'https://www.lamoncloa.gob.es/lang/en/espana/historyandculture/history/Paginas/index.aspx', 'https://education.ohio.gov/getattachment/Topics/Learning-in-Ohio/Social-Studies/Ohio-s-Learning-Standards-for-Social-Studies/SSFinalStandards01019.pdf.aspx?lang=en-US', 'https://www.nj.gov/education/cccs/2020/2020%20NJSLS-SS.pdf', 'https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/ap19-sg-european-history.pdf', 'https://www.nysed.gov/sites/default/files/programs/curriculum-instruction/ss-framework-9-12.pdf', 'https://www.colorado.edu/ptea-curriculum/becoming-modern/meiji-and-taisho-japan-introductory-essay', 'https://www.cde.ca.gov/be/st/ss/documents/histsocscistnd.pdf', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7170188/']",politics

Eventually people want something more valuable than land for their services and that is what causes feudalism to break down.","Question: How did the rise of trade and commerce in the 12th century affect the social hierarchy in Europe, considering the existing power structures and economic systems?","The rise of trade and commerce in the 12th century had a significant impact on the social hierarchy in Europe, leading to changes in the existing power structures and economic systems. The emergence of the merchant class and the growth of trade and commerce during this period challenged the traditional class structure and created new social and economic opportunities. The plague caused trade and commerce to slow, and the feudal model of agricultural production was undermined as peasants gained greater economic power. The Silk Roads played a crucial role in the spread of goods, ideas, and cultures between East and West, and the growth of trade and commerce led to the development of towns and cities. The rise of trade and commerce also led to the emergence of new social classes, such as the merchant class, and the growth of cities and towns.","['https://www.brown.edu/Departments/Italian_Studies/dweb/plague/effects/social.php', 'https://www.lhschools.org/Downloads/TCI%20Chapter%205%20The%20Decline%20of%20Feudalism.pdf', 'https://library.fiveable.me/ap-world/unit-4/class-race-1450-1750/study-guide/SxOxtXyd6i06xmVT8fj1', 'https://www.lamoncloa.gob.es/lang/en/espana/historyandculture/history/Paginas/index.aspx', 'http://spice.fsi.stanford.edu/docs/the_spread_of_islam_in_west_africa_containment_mixing_and_reform_from_the_eighth_to_the_twentieth_century', 'https://en.unesco.org/silkroad/content/did-you-know-spread-islam-southeast-asia-through-trade-routes', 'https://www.studentsofhistory.com/education-in-the-middle-ages', 'https://www.britannica.com/topic/anti-Semitism/Anti-Semitism-in-medieval-Europe', 'https://www.worldhistory.org/article/1301/trade-in-medieval-europe/', 'https://www.neshaminy.org/cms/lib6/PA01000466/Centricity/Domain/439/Chapter%204%20-%20Life%20in%20Medieval%20Towns%20FULL%20TEXT.pdf', 'https://www.brown.edu/Departments/Italian_Studies/dweb/plague/effects/social.php', 'https://www.lhschools.org/Downloads/TCI%20Chapter%205%20The%20Decline%20of%20Feudalism.pdf', 'https://library.fiveable.me/ap-world/unit-4/class-race-1450-1750/study-guide/SxOxtXyd6i06xmVT8fj1', 'https://www.lamoncloa.gob.es/lang/en/espana/historyandculture/history/Paginas/index.aspx', 'http://spice.fsi.stanford.edu/docs/the_spread_of_islam_in_west_africa_containment_mixing_and_reform_from_the_eighth_to_the_twentieth_century', 'https://en.unesco.org/silkroad/content/did-you-know-spread-islam-southeast-asia-through-trade-routes', 'https://www.studentsofhistory.com/education-in-the-middle-ages', 'https://www.britannica.com/topic/anti-Semitism/Anti-Semitism-in-medieval-Europe', 'https://www.worldhistory.org/article/1301/trade-in-medieval-europe/', 'https://www.neshaminy.org/cms/lib6/PA01000466/Centricity/Domain/439/Chapter%204%20-%20Life%20in%20Medieval%20Towns%20FULL%20TEXT.pdf', 'https://www.brown.edu/Departments/Italian_Studies/dweb/plague/effects/social.php', 'https://www.lhschools.org/Downloads/TCI%20Chapter%205%20The%20Decline%20of%20Feudalism.pdf', 'https://library.fiveable.me/ap-world/unit-4/class-race-1450-1750/study-guide/SxOxtXyd6i06xmVT8fj1', 'https://www.lamoncloa.gob.es/lang/en/espana/historyandculture/history/Paginas/index.aspx', 'http://spice.fsi.stanford.edu/docs/the_spread_of_islam_in_west_africa_containment_mixing_and_reform_from_the_eighth_to_the_twentieth_century', 'https://en.unesco.org/silkroad/content/did-you-know-spread-islam-southeast-asia-through-trade-routes', 'https://www.studentsofhistory.com/education-in-the-middle-ages', 'https://www.britannica.com/topic/anti-Semitism/Anti-Semitism-in-medieval-Europe', 'https://www.worldhistory.org/article/1301/trade-in-medieval-europe/', 'https://www.neshaminy.org/cms/lib6/PA01000466/Centricity/Domain/439/Chapter%204%20-%20Life%20in%20Medieval%20Towns%20FULL%20TEXT.pdf']",politics

Much depended on how it was implemented and what the ethics of the nobility happened to be. Eventually people want something more valuable than land for their services and that is what causes feudalism to break down.","What were the primary factors that contributed to the economic decline of Medieval Europe, and how did this decline affect the social mobility of individuals in the feudal system?","The economic decline of Medieval Europe was a complex phenomenon with multiple factors contributing to it. The primary factors that contributed to the economic decline of Medieval Europe were:

1. The Black Death, a devastating pandemic that swept across Europe in the 14th century, which led to a significant decline in the population and a shortage of labor, causing wages to rise and the economy to stagnate.
2. The decline of the feudal system, which was characterized by the rise of strong monarchies and the decline of the power of the nobility, leading to a shift from a feudal economy to a more market-based economy.
3. The rise of trade and commerce, which led to an increase in the production of goods and services, but also created new social and economic inequalities.
4. The decline of the Catholic Church, which had previously played a significant role in the economy and society of Medieval Europe, leading to a decline in the power and influence of the Church.

The decline of feudalism in Europe was a gradual process that took place over several centuries, and was characterized by the rise of nation-states and the emergence of a more modern economy. The decline of feudalism was caused by various factors, including:

1. The rise of strong monarchies, which led to a decline in the power of the nobility and the emergence of a more centralized state.
2. The growth of trade and commerce, which led to an increase in the production of goods and services and the emergence of a more market-based economy.
3. The decline of the Catholic Church, which had previously played a significant role in the economy and society of Medieval Europe, leading to a decline in the power and influence of the Church.
4. The rise of the bourgeoisie, which was a new social class that emerged during the Renaissance and the Enlightenment, and which was characterized by its emphasis on education, culture, and commerce.

The social mobility of individuals in the feudal system was limited, as people were born into a specific social class and were expected to stay within that class. However, there were some opportunities for social mobility, such as:

1. The rise of trade and commerce, which created new opportunities for individuals to improve their social status.
2. The emergence of a more modern economy, which created new social and economic inequalities and new opportunities for individuals to improve their social status.
3. The decline of the feudal system, which created new opportunities for individuals to improve their social status and to move up the social ladder.

In conclusion, the economic decline of Medieval Europe was a complex phenomenon that was caused by a combination of internal and external factors, including the Black Death, the decline of the feudal system, the rise of trade and commerce, and the decline of the Catholic Church. The decline of feudalism in Europe was a gradual process that took place over several centuries, and was characterized by the rise of nation-states and the emergence of a more modern economy. The social mobility of individuals in the feudal system was limited, but there were some opportunities for social mobility, such as the rise of trade and commerce and the emergence of a more modern economy.","['https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2015/09/28/04/53/sp082500', 'https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2015/04/02/main-factors-driving-population-growth/', 'https://www.lhschools.org/Downloads/TCI%20Chapter%205%20The%20Decline%20of%20Feudalism.pdf', 'https://www.nationalgeographic.org/article/key-components-civilization/', 'https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/RL33534.html', 'https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2019/637967/EPRS_BRI(2019)637967_EN.pdf', 'https://tea.texas.gov/student-assessment/testing/staar/staar-released-test/staar-eoc-testwhistory.pdf', 'https://www.nysed.gov/sites/default/files/programs/curriculum-instruction/ss-framework-9-12.pdf', 'https://tea.texas.gov/academics/subject-areas/social-studies/hs-world-history-studies-2024-2025-crosswalk.pdf', 'https://egrove.olemiss.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1682&context=hon_thesis', 'https://www.lhschools.org/Downloads/TCI%20Chapter%205%20The%20Decline%20of%20Feudalism.pdf', 'https://www.tutorchase.com/answers/ib/history/what-factors-contributed-to-the-decline-of-the-feudal-system', 'https://unacademy.com/content/karnataka-psc/study-material/history/decline-of-feudalism/', 'https://education.ohio.gov/getattachment/Topics/Learning-in-Ohio/Social-Studies/Model-Curriculum-for-Social-Studies/SSMC_Grade-7.pdf.aspx?lang=en-US', 'https://clas.ucdenver.edu/nhdc/sites/default/files/attached-files/entry_147.pdf', 'https://owlcation.com/humanities/decline-of-feudalism', 'https://monthlyreview.org/2020/12/01/paul-barans-economic-surplus-concept-the-baran-ratio-and-the-decline-of-feudalism/', 'https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/j.ctt183p671.5', 'https://www.mcpsmt.org/cms/lib/MT01001940/Centricity/Domain/2034/Ch.%205%20study%20guide%20answers.docx', 'https://selfstudyhistory.com/2016/04/21/q-discuss-the-causes-of-decline-of-feudalism-in-europe/', 'https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/continuity-and-change/article/social-mobility-and-the-middle-ages/BAB21B50CEE17B05C57D48D3A13CA515', 'https://www.historyextra.com/period/medieval/people-social-mobility-middle-ages-peasants-serfs/', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1dy97i/was_their_any_social_mobility_in_the_medieval/', 'https://www.quora.com/Was-there-any-social-mobility-in-the-Middle-Ages', 'https://www.jstor.org/stable/202686', 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03044181.2019.1660206', 'https://www.wappingersschools.org/cms/lib/NY01001463/Centricity/Domain/1504/Review.ppt', 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03071022.2023.2179742', 'https://www.thehistorycorner.org/articles-by-the-team/social-mobility-in-medieval-society-and-the-three-estates', 'https://courses.lumenlearning.com/atd-herkimer-westerncivilization/chapter/feudalism/']",politics
