Education systems can create a deeper awareness of sustainability, environmental stewardship, and cultural diversity by including indigenous perspectives, traditional ecological knowledge, and cultural heritage in the curriculum. However, traditional cultures often resist modern educational techniques and should be progressively transformed to embrace more innovative approaches. This necessitates interacting with communities, respecting their beliefs, and co-creating educational programmes that bridge the gap between traditional knowledge and modern abilities. Balancing cultural preservation with the learning of contemporary skills is critical for equipping young people to flourish in a fast-changing society.

To balance the need to prepare students for global careers with the need to preserve and respect local cultural knowledge and practices that may be threatened by globalization, education systems can adopt a multifaceted approach. This may include:

* Incorporating local cultural knowledge and practices into the curriculum, such as teaching traditional practices and using indigenous languages.
* Providing students with transferable knowledge, skills, habits, and mindsets that support ongoing learning and adaptability in a globalized world.
* Encouraging students to develop a sense of cultural competence and awareness, allowing them to navigate and appreciate different cultural contexts.
* Fostering partnerships and collaborations between local communities, schools, and industries to promote mutual understanding and respect.
* Providing opportunities for students to engage in experiential learning, such as internships, service-learning projects, and cultural immersion programs, to develop practical skills and knowledge in a global context.
* Encouraging students to develop a sense of global citizenship and responsibility, recognizing the interconnectedness of local and global issues.

By adopting this approach, education systems can help students develop the skills and knowledge needed to succeed in a globalized world while also preserving and respecting local cultural knowledge and practices.","['https://www.oecd.org/en/about/directorates/directorate-for-education-and-skills.html', 'https://www.socialstudies.org/national-curriculum-standards-social-studies-chapter-2-themes-social-studies', 'https://www.oecd.org/education/talis/', 'https://press.un.org/en/2019/hr5431.doc.htm', 'https://www.globalpartnership.org/blog/asia-pacific-indigenous-languages-help-safeguard-knowledge-and-culture', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/opinion/art-culture-politics.html', 'https://www.socialstudies.org/national-curriculum-standards-social-studies-chapter-2-themes-social-studies', 'https://www.oecd.org/en/about/directorates/directorate-for-education-and-skills.html', 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10888691.2018.1537791']",education

Note: The 2023 SDG 4 scores are based on the following indicators:
1. Participation rate in pre-primary organised learning (% of children aged 4 to 6)
2. Net primary enrollment rate (%)
3. Lower secondary completion rate (%)
4. Literacy rate (% of the population aged 15 to 24)
5. Tertiary educational attainment (% of the population aged 25 to 34)

7. Variation in science performance explained by socio-economic status (%)
8. Underachievers in science (% of 15-year-olds)
The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted education systems globally, leading to lost school years and increasing educational inequality. It has exacerbated the divide between the Global North and South. As restrictions became widespread, schools had to close, impacting the achievement of SDG 4 targets. However, certain countries could reopen schools earlier due to better health infrastructure and advanced educational facilities. For instance
, children in advanced economies lost an average of 15 school days in 2020. In contrast, the number increased to an average of 45 days for emerging-market economies and a staggering 72 days for children in the poorest nations. Bridging these disparities in educational losses between developed and developing countries has become crucial in the post-pandemic recovery processes, as it determines the long-term macroeconomic structure of the global economies, with youth capital playing a pivotal role.
Technology is a powerful tool for improving human capital building
and addressing structural issues in education needed for achieving equitable quality education. It has the potential to democratise knowledge access, making education more accessible and inclusive, particularly in resource-constrained countries. The growing use of educational technology (ed-tech) platforms has played a critical role in helping young people to complete their studies during the pandemic through remote learning, interactive material, and individualised learning experiences. Thanks to open educational resources (OERs), online courses, and digital libraries, learners can access educational materials at their own pace and convenience—which was extremely helpful during the pandemic.

"The challenges facing young people today are unprecedented. From lost educational opportunities due to the pandemic-induced lockdowns to the looming climate crisis, dangerous virtual spaces, and concerns over food and energy security triggered by geopolitical conflicts—the hurdles they face are numerous, complex, and interconnected. However, young people worldwide are rising to these challenges, coalescing around issues, and creating innovative solutions that consider diverse cultures, geographies, and development statuses. The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4 on Quality Education, recognises the pivotal role that education plays in achieving comprehensive development in the longer horizon. It aims
to ‘ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all’, especially for the youth to thrive in the modern world.
Table 1: SDG 4 Scores (2023)

Reimagining tech in education
|SDG 4 Scores (out of 100)
|Eastern Europe and Central Asia
|East and South Asia
|Latin America and the Caribbean
|Middle East and North Africa
|Small Island Developing States
Note: The 2023 SDG 4 scores are based on the following indicators:
1. Participation rate in pre-primary organised learning (% of children aged 4 to 6)
2. Net primary enrollment rate (%)
3. Lower secondary completion rate (%)
4. Literacy rate (% of the population aged 15 to 24)
5. Tertiary educational attainment (% of the population aged 25 to 34)
6. PISA score (worst 0-600 best)
7. Variation in science performance explained by socio-economic status (%)
8. Underachievers in science (% of 15-year-olds)
The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted education systems globally, leading to lost school years and increasing educational inequality. It has exacerbated the divide between the Global North and South. As restrictions became widespread, schools had to close, impacting the achievement of SDG 4 targets. However, certain countries could reopen schools earlier due to better health infrastructure and advanced educational facilities. For instance
, children in advanced economies lost an average of 15 school days in 2020. In contrast, the number increased to an average of 45 days for emerging-market economies and a staggering 72 days for children in the poorest nations. Bridging these disparities in educational losses between developed and developing countries has become crucial in the post-pandemic recovery processes, as it determines the long-term macroeconomic structure of the global economies, with youth capital playing a pivotal role.
Technology is a powerful tool for improving human capital building
and addressing structural issues in education needed for achieving equitable quality education. It has the potential to democratise knowledge access, making education more accessible and inclusive, particularly in resource-constrained countries. The growing use of educational technology (ed-tech) platforms has played a critical role in helping young people to complete their studies during the pandemic through remote learning, interactive material, and individualised learning experiences. Thanks to open educational resources (OERs), online courses, and digital libraries, learners can access educational materials at their own pace and convenience—which was extremely helpful during the pandemic.
Nevertheless, technology alone is insufficient
. The human element is crucial in delivering localised and contextualised education. While ed-tech platforms provide access to educational content, they should be complemented with effective pedagogical strategies and teacher support. Blended learning (combining online and in-person instructions) can accelerate learning and increase accessibility, particularly in developing countries where infrastructure limitations may persist.
also plays a vital role in fostering collaboration, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills. Thus, education systems can foster a sense of community and promote social cohesion by creating opportunities for young people to work together, share knowledge, and learn from one another. Moreover, policy-making in education reform must be guided by feminist principles of inclusivity, considering dimensions such as global citizenship, finance, and the environment. Financial literacy
and entrepreneurship education can equip them with the skills to navigate the complex economic landscape and pursue innovative solutions to social and environmental challenges.","How can governments balance the need to invest in education with the need to address the increasing burden of climate change, and what role can educational institutions play in promoting sustainable economic development and reducing economic inequality?

Digital communication platforms, such as emails, messaging apps, and online portals, facilitate real-time updates on a student's progress, upcoming events, and important announcements. This seamless communication enhances parental involvement in a child's education, creating a collaborative partnership between educators and families.
Additionally, parents can actively participate in their child's learning journey through online resources and interactive platforms. This not only strengthens the support system for students but also fosters a sense of community within the school environment.
Economic Opportunities and Entrepreneurship
The integration of technology in education aligns with the demands of the contemporary job market. Students equipped with technological skills are better positioned to navigate the professional landscape and contribute to economic growth. Moreover, technology facilitates the development of entrepreneurial skills, empowering students to explore innovative solutions and turn their ideas into viable ventures.
Online platforms also provide opportunities for skill development in emerging fields, allowing individuals to acquire in-demand skills that are crucial for career advancement. This connectivity to the digital economy prepares students for the dynamic nature of the modern workplace and encourages a mindset of adaptability and resilience.
Conclusion: Balancing the Waves of Change
The impact of technology on education is profound, reshaping the landscape of learning in once unimaginable ways. From digital classrooms to personalized learning, the educational journey has been infused with innovation. However, as we navigate these waters, it is crucial to strike a balance, addressing challenges such as the digital divide and the potential loss of human connection.

Furthermore, virtual classrooms and online collaboration tools diminish the need for extensive travel, reducing the carbon footprint associated with commuting to and from educational institutions. Embracing technology in education aligns with broader efforts to promote environmental sustainability and instills eco-conscious values in the younger generation.
Parental Involvement and Communication
Technology has transformed the way educators communicate with parents and guardians. Digital communication platforms, such as emails, messaging apps, and online portals, facilitate real-time updates on a student's progress, upcoming events, and important announcements. This seamless communication enhances parental involvement in a child's education, creating a collaborative partnership between educators and families.
Additionally, parents can actively participate in their child's learning journey through online resources and interactive platforms. This not only strengthens the support system for students but also fosters a sense of community within the school environment.
Economic Opportunities and Entrepreneurship
The integration of technology in education aligns with the demands of the contemporary job market. Students equipped with technological skills are better positioned to navigate the professional landscape and contribute to economic growth. Moreover, technology facilitates the development of entrepreneurial skills, empowering students to explore innovative solutions and turn their ideas into viable ventures.
Online platforms also provide opportunities for skill development in emerging fields, allowing individuals to acquire in-demand skills that are crucial for career advancement. This connectivity to the digital economy prepares students for the dynamic nature of the modern workplace and encourages a mindset of adaptability and resilience.
Conclusion: Balancing the Waves of Change
The impact of technology on education is profound, reshaping the landscape of learning in once unimaginable ways. From digital classrooms to personalized learning, the educational journey has been infused with innovation. However, as we navigate these waters, it is crucial to strike a balance, addressing challenges such as the digital divide and the potential loss of human connection.
In this dynamic educational landscape, the compass points towards a future where technology and tradition coexist harmoniously, ensuring that the benefits of innovation are accessible to all.

Global Education: Empowering the Next Generation
In an increasingly interconnected world, global education has emerged as a crucial component of preparing students for the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century. It goes beyond traditional academic subjects, aiming to foster global citizenship, cultural understanding, and a sense of shared responsibility for our planet.
Global education equips students with the knowledge, skills, and attitudes necessary to navigate an interconnected world. It encourages them to think critically about global issues such as poverty, climate change, human rights, and social justice. By examining these complex challenges from multiple perspectives, students develop empathy and gain a deeper understanding of the world around them.
One key aspect of global education is promoting cultural competence. In our diverse societies, it is essential for students to appreciate and respect different cultures and traditions. By learning about other cultures’ histories, languages, religions, and customs, students develop a broader worldview that fosters tolerance and inclusivity.
Moreover, global education encourages interdisciplinary learning by integrating various subjects such as geography, history, economics, environmental science, and social studies. This multidisciplinary approach helps students connect the dots between different disciplines and understand how they intersect in addressing global challenges.
Technology plays a pivotal role in global education by breaking down geographical barriers. Through virtual exchanges and online collaborations with peers from different countries or cultures, students can engage in meaningful dialogue and learn from one another’s perspectives. These digital connections enable them to develop cross-cultural communication skills essential for success in today’s interconnected workforce.
Global education also emphasizes active engagement through service-learning projects or community involvement. By participating in local or international initiatives aimed at addressing social issues like poverty or inequality, students develop a sense of agency and realize their potential to make a positive impact on their communities – both locally and globally.
Furthermore, global education prepares students for an increasingly globalized job market. Employers are seeking individuals with intercultural competence who can collaborate effectively across borders and understand the complexities of global markets. By nurturing skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, adaptability, and cultural sensitivity, global education equips students with a competitive edge in today’s global workforce.
To ensure the success of global education, collaboration among educators, policymakers, and communities is crucial. Governments must prioritize the integration of global education into national curricula and provide professional development opportunities for teachers to enhance their knowledge and pedagogical strategies.
In conclusion, global education is a transformative approach that empowers the next generation to become active global citizens. By fostering cultural understanding, critical thinking, and a sense of shared responsibility, it equips students with the skills needed to navigate an interconnected world. As we strive for a more inclusive and sustainable future, investing in global education is not just desirable but imperative. Together, let us empower our students to create positive change on a local and global scale.

Note that the subtopic ""Plagiarism detection software"" does not appear in the question, and the words in the subtopic are not used in the question.","The final answer to the original input question is:

The use of plagiarism detection software in Initial Teacher Education courses can have significant implications on educational workplace cultures and practices, including transformative changes, biases, outdated training data, and lack of transparency. The consequences of using such software can be severe, including falsely accusing students and damaging their academic reputation. To promote academic integrity in Initial Teacher Education courses, educators can use various strategies, such as teaching students to avoid plagiarism, promoting a culture of acceptance and ethical vision, and implementing TILT practices that help students understand learning goals and outcomes.","['https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6429805/', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0268401223000233', 'https://leonfurze.com/2024/05/27/dont-use-genai-to-grade-student-work/comment-page-1/', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6429805/', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0268401223000233', 'https://www.ibo.org/globalassets/new-structure/programmes/shared-resources/pdfs/academic-integrity-policy-en.pdf', 'https://leonfurze.com/2024/05/27/dont-use-genai-to-grade-student-work/comment-page-1/', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/14afmpj/what_to_do_after_you_are_falsely_accused_of_using/', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6429805/', 'https://ctl.columbia.edu/resources-and-technology/resources/academic-integrity/', 'https://academicintegrity.org/resources/blog/126-2024/march-2024/494-four-teaching-practices-that-promote-academic-integrity', 'https://www.ibo.org/globalassets/new-structure/programmes/shared-resources/pdfs/academic-integrity-policy-en.pdf']",education

However, educators may face challenges and limitations, such as maintaining cultural integrity, adapting to different learning styles, and addressing historical trauma.

"Okay, how do I follow that? Hello, my name is John Cope, and I'm Head of Education and Skills Policy at the CBI. The Confederation of British Industry represents about 190,000 businesses also. So my job is kind of one foot in business, listen to CEOs, managing directors of companies of all sizes, all sectors across the UK and internationally. But also we have a sort of a microcosm of the education system in membership as well says that 80 or 90 universities that are members of the CBI, including Nottingham Trent, with 40 or 50 colleges are members. We also have really strong links with school trusts, as well as the independent sector. So I kind of come at this from a from both angles and in those conversations. ones that I have for business leaders, it doesn't take very long until the topic of conversation goes to education skills, it does tend to be the number one priority for them. And it's that kind of mix of wanting a more productive, more vibrant economy. Combined with that kind of social good aspects of education, make sure everyone gets a good start in life. And I have a really strong belief actually, the employers have a huge role to play education skills, and a mentor or point officer role, the duty to do so to get involved with schools getting by with colleges and universities. And too often that role can be not quite as advanced as it could be. And I suppose the thing I would add about my work at the CBI education skills is that we come from the start point, but there is no reason why a young person shouldn't have a fantastic career. Every young person should have that career. There is no reason why you should have regional differences, why different young people from different backgrounds should start their career in a different way. So we come from that start point that talent is equally distributed, but opportunity is not. And and employers have a role in affecting that. And despite the million plus, or so students who they're good or outstanding school, and over the last 10 years or so, despite the very welcome, focus on rigor and knowledge in the curriculum, and also the sort of innovation in education that a lot of Multi Academy Trusts are pursuing, it still remains the case that there is a significant disadvantage gap means young people at the age of 16 can be nearly two years behind the more advantaged peers. And from a CBI perspective, not only is that morally questionable, and we allow that situation to happen, but actually that disadvantage gap is lost business leaders, it's lost scientists, it's lost innovators, lost leaders of the future. And we have a duty to address it.
Thank you very much. And I'm going to start the questioning off with a little reflection really of my own IT digital background in that when I started teaching, and we didn't have computers, and and we certainly didn't have the digital natives that we now have in our classrooms. And I've got two daughters, who, you know, the the technology is as comfortable with them as a book, you know, as it was with when I was growing up. So, in terms of the future, what skills are young people our digital natives going to need for the future? And how can schools provide them when they're staffed by a lot of people who weren't digital natives? Maybe Nancy first?
Yeah, very happy to take this one first. And I actually think so. So I think it's a really interesting question, and I actually feel like there's some of the skills that are most needed in the kind of work. I was on a panel yesterday talking about the fourth industrial revolution. So I don't really like that term that much. But considering technology is changing all of our lives and automation is going to change lots of the jobs that young people are going to go into in the future. I actually kind of think, alongside the digital skills that you've mentioned, it's the skills or kind of more human skills that we really need to foster in young people. Things like collaboration and problem solving, we know is really important teamwork, as well as the social and social and emotional skills and resilience that are going to be so important in our in our changing world as we as we all know it. Nesta produce some research a couple of years ago on the future of work and found that the skills I've just mentioned, those are most likely to grow in the future world of work and be important.

Students are not in school for one specific objective and schools should not be operating like factories or enterprises. Students and learners must remain central and safeguarded.

Innovative ways to use storytelling to promote environmental awareness among students:

1. Digital storytelling: Utilize digital technology to create interactive and immersive stories that engage students and promote environmental awareness.
2. Virtual field trips: Organize virtual field trips to explore environmental issues and promote learning through technology.
3. Environmental podcasts: Create podcasts that tell stories about environmental issues and promote sustainability.
4. Gamification: Use game design elements to create interactive and engaging stories that promote environmental awareness and action.
5. Collaborative storytelling: Encourage students to work together to create stories that promote environmental awareness and sustainability.

Benefits of technology in education:

1. Increased accessibility: Technology can provide access to educational resources and opportunities for students who may not have had access otherwise.
2. Personalized learning: Technology can help tailor learning experiences to individual students' needs and abilities.
3. Enhanced engagement: Technology can make learning more engaging and interactive, which can increase student motivation and participation.
4. Cost-effective: Technology can reduce costs associated with traditional educational methods, such as textbooks and travel.

Drawbacks of technology in education:

1. Distractions: Technology can be distracting and take away from the learning experience.
2. Overreliance: Overreliance on technology can lead to a lack of critical thinking and problem-solving skills.
3. Inequity: Technology can exacerbate existing inequities in education, such as access to devices and internet connectivity.
4. Addiction: Technology can be addictive, leading to negative impacts on mental and physical health.

By considering both the benefits and drawbacks of technology in education, educators can use storytelling to promote environmental awareness among students in innovative and effective ways.","['https://www.rvaconnect.org/kaleidoscope-kids', 'https://sustainable-earth.org/art-and-creativity/', 'https://manoa.hawaii.edu/cinema/staff-member/scott-schimmel/', 'https://www.allisonacademy.com/students/education/technology-in-education/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-technology-in-education/', 'https://www.celebree.com/the-pros-and-cons-of-technology-in-education/', 'https://www.21kschool.com/in/blog/the-pros-and-cons-of-using-education-technology/', ""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/353305185_Utilizing_Digital_Storytelling_to_Foster_Pupil's_Language_and_Environmental_Awareness_and_Action"", 'https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2024/02/technology-in-education', 'https://www.enel.com/company/stories/articles/2023/06/three-pillars-sustainability']",education

"Yeah, they are. I would add, I suppose that is to reinforce just how critical this is, you know, we often do surveys of our members. And whenever we ask them about where their vacancies are, where their skills gaps, we have a very consistent number that about two thirds of our members will come back and say, actually, they have digital vacancies. So they have jobs there in digital, they cannot fill. And digital is the area where they know they're going to have great skill gaps over the coming years and will invest the most. So for solutions, which I guess is at the heart of this question, I think the first thing is to try and get away from thinking of digital as a subject. And, you know, we used to have ICT lessons and things like that, and I know I did, I had a one hour or month or something like that there was on ICT. I never quite know what the value of that that was. So I think he's getting away from it as a subject and actually viewing it much more along the same lines as numeracy literacy. Actually, digital needs to be weaved into every single subject. And it needs to be core to everything. And so I suppose it's that first year getting getting away from as a subject and thinking of it much more as a competency is something that that should be embedded. The second point I'd make, I suppose, is about the breadth of the curriculum. And this is quite sort of quite a wide point I suppose to make just about, I'd say obviously what is the point of GCSE is now given that most young people are all young people stay in educational change at what is the purpose of GCSEs at 16. So, you know, our members of regularly will sort of say to us that they feel that young people are getting a more and more and more narrow curriculum, and how can that be broadened? So one of the questions that were asking at the CBI do regularly ask of government is, is now the right time to start that conversation about rethinking GCSEs entirely about was the point exams, huge amount of pressure and capacity put into 16, but actually mostly stay in to 18 and that that creates the opportunity to have a lot more creativity subjects which have declined over the last 10 years. It also broadens out to help this show be embedded in more and on to the next stage who some amazing analysis done by the Royal Society, about A-Levels over how disadvantaged young people, on average to 2.4 A-Levels to 2.4 subjects. So the idea that a young person by the age of 18 can narrow themselves down to less than three subjects at the age of 18. feels wrong to me. And I think the the changing world of work, globalisation, ai automation requires greater breadth than ever. And yet we're going the opposite direction and actually narrowing down and I I would add on then on to the next stage on to higher education and technical, first and higher education. And I think culturally, and regulatory and pretty much every part of the system and the financial system drives universities to very traditional approaches to higher education. Everything drives towards three year bachelor's degrees. And that's sort of what everyone hopes for that's the sign of success that parents looking for and that's what the finance system encourages. And actually moving away from that and encourage much more flexible, innovative distance digital provision. Now like that of the Open University, I was there only a couple of months ago. And they were showing me they have, they have a free satellite that they can control and they, they, they you can use it as part of education. Anyone can use it, they have a, a satellite or satellite dish, it's a telescope that's it, the word I'm looking for a telescope that is in, I think it was either Tenerife or Fuerteventura in the middle of nowhere, that all their students can use as part of their education, these kinds of innovations the university is able to do with their model we self see replicated, and then very quickly finally as I'm talking for a while. On the technical education side and, you know, higher education, I think you'd agree he's put on quite well over the last 10 or 20 years or so. And the part of the system that really is creaking is colleges, further education and adult education. And I think the government and all parties now acknowledge this on the funding side. But actually, we need to make sure that there's the capital investment, so that actually, neither the colleges and FE can invest in technology can invest in the things I just described over Open University in order to actually give a really high level innovative education.

The ability of highly intuitive individuals to perceive patterns in seemingly unrelated events after an emotional shift can be leveraged to make more informed decisions by leveraging their creative thinking and emotional intelligence. This can be achieved by being aware of their emotions and how they affect their thoughts and behaviors, and by using this awareness to recognize patterns and make data-driven decisions.","['https://www.quora.com/How-do-the-thoughts-of-highly-gifted-people-differ-from-those-who-are-not', 'https://www.askamanager.org/2022/01/the-new-hire-who-showed-up-is-not-the-same-person-we-interviewed.html', 'https://www.quora.com/What-is-it-like-to-have-very-strong-intuition', 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28257244/', 'https://community.openai.com/t/integration-of-emotional-intelligence-in-ai-development-of-rational-emotion-pattern-concepts-and-metrics/830018', 'https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/emotional-awareness-recognizing-your-emotions-effects-david-owasi', 'https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/data-driven-decision-making', 'https://www.linkedin.com/posts/animeshjain1996_your-intuition-is-right-more-often-than-you-activity-7176792047440343040-xzcz', 'https://www.rib-software.com/en/blogs/data-driven-decision-making-in-businesses']",education

Answer : The reason why you have to study math, logic, history, physics, and the sciences is so that you can perceive a multi-faceted Perspective that will allow you to understand your Point of Origin and a wider range of comprehension so you can make educated decisions that take into account catalyst, chain reaction, and consequence to your choices, leading you to a happier life.
The reason why we must study art, music, dance, and theater is to nurture our ability to imagine, which is the fountainhead required for problems solving, authority, autonomy, independent thinking, and thinking “outside of the box.” It is the core of Perspective Shifting so you can view a single topic, problem, or situation from multiple angles.
Math, Physics, and the Sciences help you manage your Logical Health and sharpen your Intuitive Logic so you can better navigate yourself through life resulting in little to no Mental Illness. Leading to Effective Communication so you can transfer and receive information, and so you can make healthy connections and nourish those connections resulting in a strong network and circuit of likeminded individuals.

They internalize their own actions onto others with the belief that “If someone is smarter than me, then they will make me their slave,” because that is what they would do.
Education is Power. And that is what this is really about. Monopolizing the Power so that those in charge stay in charge. And those without Power stay ignorant and obedient (submissive).

This can be done by using Google search snippets to find relevant information and sharing it with the students. Next, the teacher can use problem-solving activities and critical thinking exercises to help students apply their skills to practical contexts. This can include activities such as discussing abstract situations, watching videos, and working in groups.

So you think about finance, very easy to automate, very easy to use AI and huge swathes of the financial sector. So you know, we can look at the kind of sectors that currently we because it'll be very high paid, very high skilled, actually, they're as vulnerable as drivers. For instance, obviously, the automation of cars would affect. So there's a sense of urgency, the fourth industrial revolution, there's a need to have a nuanced view that will impact all of us in in different ways. And it also needs to be set alongside other challenges that we have.

And if will retire at all. And so the idea that actually we front load education, the idea that we can pour as much education as possible by the age of 18, and 21. If that ever was possible, that idea is certainly dead by now. And then the need to go into lifelong learning is incredibly important. And the second point I was going to make around the sort of frameworks and skills and you have a five pound for every skills framework, I was asked to look at and say just this, will this make the young person work ready, I'd be a very wealthy person. And we did a bit of a literature review of all these frameworks. And you can find about 200 of them. They all use different language, different interpretations, different perspectives on the same thing. And if I'm honest, one of the big problems we have is there are so many of these frameworks, it's deeply confusing for both employers, teachers and young people to actually understand what are the skills that we need? So in order to try and cut through that a little bit, we're at CBI, we set out as a kind of an attempt to answer the question, what does it mean for a young person to work ready? It comes down to three quite simple things. First and foremost is knowledge. There's no escaping that actually knowledge rich curriculum is absolutely vital.

1. Virtual reality scavenger hunts: Divide students into teams and assign them a virtual reality scavenger hunt, where they have to work together to find and collect virtual objects or complete challenges.
2. Collaborative virtual reality projects: Assign students a virtual reality project that requires them to work together to create a virtual reality experience, such as a virtual museum or a virtual city.
3. Virtual reality role-playing: Use virtual reality to simulate real-life scenarios, such as a virtual hospital or a virtual business, and have students work together to solve problems and complete tasks.
4. Virtual reality game development: Have students work together to develop a virtual reality game, where they can design and build levels, characters, and challenges.
5. Virtual reality field trips: Take students on virtual reality field trips to places they may not be able to visit in person, such as historical landmarks or other countries, and have them work together to complete tasks and challenges.

The potential benefits of implementing virtual reality collaboration tools and strategies in a classroom setting include:

1. Improved teamwork and social skills: Virtual reality can help students develop teamwork and social skills by providing them with opportunities to work together and communicate effectively.
2. Increased engagement and motivation: Virtual reality can increase student engagement and motivation by providing them with immersive and interactive learning experiences.
3. Enhanced creativity and problem-solving skills: Virtual reality can help students develop their creativity and problem-solving skills by providing them with opportunities to design and build virtual reality experiences.
4. Improved knowledge retention: Virtual reality can help students retain knowledge better by providing them with interactive and immersive learning experiences.
5. Increased accessibility: Virtual reality can provide students with disabilities or those who may not have access to certain resources with equal opportunities to participate in learning experiences.

What has become clear to me in the time since I began my career in the field, is the schools we need now, and that we will continue to need long after I have retired are will be places where great expertise comes together to create a place that cannot be created by any one individual. Our future schools depend on:
- Information technology that is always functioning and available to all students and teachers.
- Teaching and learning that is diverse and responsive to the needs to teachers and learners and that prepares all for the unpredictable future.
- Decisions made that ensure these schools exist and that all families can send their children to one of these schools.","How might the widespread adoption of AI-powered tutoring tools in classrooms impact the development of critical thinking skills in students, and what potential unintended consequences might arise from relying too heavily on these tools?

Note that the question does not mention learning analytics, but it requires expertise in the area to provide a thoughtful and informed response.","The widespread adoption of AI-powered tutoring tools in classrooms may have both positive and negative impacts on the development of critical thinking skills in students. While AI tools can provide personalized support and enhance learning outcomes, they may also lead to a decline in critical thinking skills if students become overly dependent on them. To mitigate the risks, it is essential to strike a balance between technology and human interaction by incorporating AI tools as supplements to traditional teaching methods, rather than replacing them entirely.","['https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666374023000717', 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/2331186X.2023.2236469', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666920X23000267', 'https://www.bridgeport.edu/news/ai-impact-on-neurodiverse-users/', 'https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-potential-consequences-of-relying-too-heavily-on-artificial-intelligence-and-automation-in-various-aspects-of-our-lives-and-how-can-we-mitigate-these-risks-to-ensure-a-more-balanced-and-equitable-future', 'https://www.techbusinessnews.com.au/blog/chatgpt-may-lead-to-the-downfall-of-eduction-and-critical-thinking/', 'https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-potential-consequences-of-relying-too-heavily-on-artificial-intelligence-and-automation-in-various-aspects-of-our-lives-and-how-can-we-mitigate-these-risks-to-ensure-a-more-balanced-and-equitable-future', 'https://plat.ai/blog/early-ai-exposure-on-kids-cognitive-development/', 'https://www.educationnext.org/a-i-in-education-leap-into-new-era-machine-intelligence-carries-risks-challenges-promises/', 'https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Artificial-Intelligence-in/Balancing-Human-Touch-with-AI-in-Education/ba-p/590952', 'https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/striking-right-balance-ai-human-interaction-education-mark-dzhge', 'https://achievingthedream.org/the-balancing-act-of-teaching-with-ai/']",education

These institutions have a rich history of producing successful graduates who have contributed significantly to various fields.
Challenges in Education
Accessibility and Affordability
Despite the city’s educational diversity, accessibility to quality education remains a significant challenge for many residents. The cost of education in private institutions can be prohibitive for some, and public schools often face resource constraints.
Quality of Education
Maintaining high standards of education is another concern. While prestigious institutions offer world-class education, many others struggle to meet the required benchmarks.

"The only way this can be done effectively is with good communication. Having communication skills means less stress, more productivity, and better relationships. Future employers need to be able to communicate with people within their team, as well as people outside of the team and organization.
Working in groups is a hallmark of the digital age. Our classrooms and businesses incorporate teamwork into their daily practices and also foster a culture of competition and independence rather than one of teamwork and collaboration. As such, collaborative abilities have a permanent place among the most beneficial lifelong learning skills all students should develop. Future employers will need to quickly adapt to a culture of collaboration. They will need to collaborate with others within and outside of the organization, often using a number of new technologies.
This means being able to work in groups that are both physical and virtual. It includes proficiency in communication, empathy, and leadership values. It also means being able to work with someone across the world as easily and productively as someone across the room. This is why Collaboration skill is one of the Essential Skills being taught in classrooms all over the world.
Leaders are an asset in any classroom and in every workforce. Anyone whose attitude moves from “I can do it” to “we can do it” makes everybody better. It's their independence and willingness to take responsibility for making good things happen, not just simply getting things done. That's why leaders see more, do more, and learn more.
Understanding leadership is one of those beneficial lifelong learning skills that can change people's lives. After all, one who leads isn't just one who manages things. What a leader does is inspire, motivate, and empower. True leaders see the best in people and teach them to harness their potential in all they do.
Problem Solving Skills
The world is changing and will continue changing dramatically. As such our children will be solving future problems that we can't even imagine yet. They'll face challenges that require skills to define a problem, design an appropriate solution, and put it to effective use.
Problem-solving skills help them tackle anything from writing a shopping list to designing and realizing their biggest dreams. As far as beneficial lifelong learning skills go, this one is probably the most important. Solving real-world problems with a process like Solution Fluency is crucial to surviving and thriving in the present and future.
Critical Thinking Skills
The way we think about the world, ourselves and each other affects more than just personal experience. It has a part in defining the future of everything and everyone and the entire world—this is the “Ripple Effect.” It's been a part of many cultural philosophies for thousands of years, reminding us that how we choose to think and act influences our whole world. We don't have to be overwhelmed by it, just simply aware of it as it guides our critical thinking practices.
There is a decreased emphasis on employers following directions and an increased emphasis on employers thinking critically and solving problems. In a rapidly changing world, employers need employees who can solve problems, provide ideas and help improve the organization. The ability to think critically is a must for future success in a changing world. It's about thinking independently, responsibly, and productively. In fact, one of the best definitions of critical thinking can be found on the Critical Thinking Web. The latest term is used in thinking skills as ‘Internet of Thinking' (IoT).
Information Management Skills
Dealing with information means we can determine what is valuable and discard what is spurious or questionable. This is important for producing solutions and products that are genuine and useful. It's also an aspect of research and proper attribution of sources, things every good digital citizen needs to know. Information is essentially all things on the Internet, and it's alive and growing.
Personal Management Skills
Personal management is one of the basic skills to overcome future challenges. This includes the ability for employers to independently plan, organize, create and execute, rather than wait for someone to do this for them.
Curiosity and Inquiry Skills
Without curiosity and inquiry skills there is no learning effectively. Lifelong learning is driven by curiosity. Outside the rigours of school, there is no educator or peer to motivate us to learn and expand our minds. Developing curiosity is undoubtedly one of the most beneficial lifelong learning skills you can have. Nurturing curiosity can lead to moments where a learner says, “wow, I never expected that in school.”","How can a manager effectively balance the need for clear direction with the need for autonomy and flexibility in a team working on a high-stakes project, while also considering the diverse communication styles of team members from different cultural backgrounds?","To effectively balance direction, autonomy, and flexibility in a high-stakes project with diverse team members, a manager should focus on building trust, fostering open communication, and adapting leadership styles to suit the team's needs.

To maintain their relevance, human educators can use strategies such as:

* Focusing on pedagogical strategies that AI systems may not be able to detect or address, such as ""teachable moments"" and nuanced student interactions.
* Developing skills in areas where AI is not yet effective, such as emotional intelligence, conflict resolution, and complex problem-solving.
* Collaborating with AI systems to augment their own teaching practices, rather than replacing them.
* Emphasizing the importance of human relationships and social-emotional learning in education, as highlighted by the California Department of Education.

"Digital technologies are making a huge impact on our daily lives. We can already witness a number of effects of Internet on social life, but the influence of IT tools and programs spreads way beyond that.
Education is one of the fields that experience the most significant changes. According to the research, eLearning increases retention rates by 25% to 60%, which is the main reason why the global market is growing rapidly and projected to be worth $325 billion by 2025.
Online learning technologies are improving education in many different ways and getting increasingly popular among students and business professionals all over the world. Now, the key question is: How can online platforms change the way we learn in 2020?
We prepared a whole list of answers for you, so keep reading to see 10 ways digital technologies are going to enhance learning next year!
Online platforms encourage interactions
We begin with a feature that benefits and augments traditional learning practices in particular. Namely, online platforms enhance classroom-based studying and take it outside schools and colleges by encouraging social interactions between students and teachers.
For example, a professor can quickly create a Facebook group and invite his/her students to join the community. They can use the group to share ideas, upload documents, discuss classroom topics, exchange learning materials, and many more.
This is also the way to promote interactions among peers and help them break social barriers through online conversations.
Education becomes globally accessible
Unlike traditional learning, online education is globally accessible. How come? The idea is simple – all it takes is a stable Internet connection to gain access to various learning resources. A report reveals that almost four billion people use the Internet on a global scale.
In other words, more than half of the world’s population is able to find and use online studying tools at any given moment. This makes eLearning an unprecedented phenomenon that drastically changes the entire education market. Such a high level of accessibility can help people all over the world to begin studying and increasing the odds of making a career breakthrough.
Besides that, online learning is not time-bound as there are no plans, schedules, and calendars. It means that students can learn their lessons whenever they choose to.
A growing number of learning resources
The Internet is literally endless, so the only logical conclusion is that it can gradually build an all-encompassing library of learning resources. Of course, it will take years or even decades to systemize and categorize online studying resources, but it’s clear that the concept itself is incredibly powerful.
You don’t have to go beyond Wikipedia to understand the effect of online platforms on education. Although not perfect, Wikipedia already gives comprehensive and accurate answers to many questions and makes the studying process faster and simpler. There are also millions of other resources, including digital courses, eBooks, webinars, etc.
Free learning resources
This feature goes hand in hand with the previous one. Namely, the Internet is packed with learning resources that are not only valuable but also free of charge. We already mentioned Wikipedia as one example, but there many other platforms to check out. Some of the best free resources are:
- Project Gutenberg: If you are interested in free eBooks, this platform will give you over 60 thousand options.
- YouTube EDU: Video learning fans can find amazing materials on YouTube EDU.
- Udemy: You can find a plethora of free courses on Udemy.
Online learning assistance programs
The days when students had to do all the work on their own are long gone. Today, the Internet is offering you dozens of high-quality learning assistance programs. Using their services, you can plan and write school or college papers in a matter of hours.
The only problem is how to choose the best platforms from a wide range of more or less similar services, but we can give you a hand by pointing out proven solutions in the field. In our experience, the best content creation platforms are essay writing service, uk-dissertation.com, and essay writing help.
Imagine how great it would be to have the option of personalizing your learning experiences. As it turns out, you don’t have to dream about it anymore because eLearning makes it possible to customize your studies and make it fit your learning style exclusively.
Most tools have powerful analytics and so they can predict your needs, learning style, and pace. In such circumstances, you can enjoy the privilege of individualized learning and keep the rhythm that suits your requirements.
Gamification in eLearning
The personalization of eLearning is one thing, but gamification is yet another feature that makes the process so precious. Game-like elements make students more interested and engaged, which drastically increases retention rates.","What strategies can be used to improve the accessibility of online educational resources for students with limited English proficiency, without relying solely on machine translation tools?

"Digital technologies are making a huge impact on our daily lives. We can already witness a number of effects of Internet on social life, but the influence of IT tools and programs spreads way beyond that.
Education is one of the fields that experience the most significant changes. According to the research, eLearning increases retention rates by 25% to 60%, which is the main reason why the global market is growing rapidly and projected to be worth $325 billion by 2025.
Online learning technologies are improving education in many different ways and getting increasingly popular among students and business professionals all over the world. Now, the key question is: How can online platforms change the way we learn in 2020?
We prepared a whole list of answers for you, so keep reading to see 10 ways digital technologies are going to enhance learning next year!
Online platforms encourage interactions
We begin with a feature that benefits and augments traditional learning practices in particular. Namely, online platforms enhance classroom-based studying and take it outside schools and colleges by encouraging social interactions between students and teachers.
For example, a professor can quickly create a Facebook group and invite his/her students to join the community. They can use the group to share ideas, upload documents, discuss classroom topics, exchange learning materials, and many more.
This is also the way to promote interactions among peers and help them break social barriers through online conversations.
Education becomes globally accessible
Unlike traditional learning, online education is globally accessible. How come? The idea is simple – all it takes is a stable Internet connection to gain access to various learning resources. A report reveals that almost four billion people use the Internet on a global scale.
In other words, more than half of the world’s population is able to find and use online studying tools at any given moment. This makes eLearning an unprecedented phenomenon that drastically changes the entire education market. Such a high level of accessibility can help people all over the world to begin studying and increasing the odds of making a career breakthrough.
Besides that, online learning is not time-bound as there are no plans, schedules, and calendars. It means that students can learn their lessons whenever they choose to.
A growing number of learning resources
The Internet is literally endless, so the only logical conclusion is that it can gradually build an all-encompassing library of learning resources. Of course, it will take years or even decades to systemize and categorize online studying resources, but it’s clear that the concept itself is incredibly powerful.
You don’t have to go beyond Wikipedia to understand the effect of online platforms on education. Although not perfect, Wikipedia already gives comprehensive and accurate answers to many questions and makes the studying process faster and simpler. There are also millions of other resources, including digital courses, eBooks, webinars, etc.
Free learning resources
This feature goes hand in hand with the previous one. Namely, the Internet is packed with learning resources that are not only valuable but also free of charge. We already mentioned Wikipedia as one example, but there many other platforms to check out. Some of the best free resources are:
- Project Gutenberg: If you are interested in free eBooks, this platform will give you over 60 thousand options.
- YouTube EDU: Video learning fans can find amazing materials on YouTube EDU.
- Udemy: You can find a plethora of free courses on Udemy.
Online learning assistance programs
The days when students had to do all the work on their own are long gone. Today, the Internet is offering you dozens of high-quality learning assistance programs. Using their services, you can plan and write school or college papers in a matter of hours.
The only problem is how to choose the best platforms from a wide range of more or less similar services, but we can give you a hand by pointing out proven solutions in the field. In our experience, the best content creation platforms are essay writing service, uk-dissertation.com, and essay writing help.
Imagine how great it would be to have the option of personalizing your learning experiences. As it turns out, you don’t have to dream about it anymore because eLearning makes it possible to customize your studies and make it fit your learning style exclusively.
Most tools have powerful analytics and so they can predict your needs, learning style, and pace. In such circumstances, you can enjoy the privilege of individualized learning and keep the rhythm that suits your requirements.
Gamification in eLearning
The personalization of eLearning is one thing, but gamification is yet another feature that makes the process so precious. Game-like elements make students more interested and engaged, which drastically increases retention rates.","Can a university effectively integrate online learning platforms with on-campus activities to foster a sense of community among students?

Ans. Sanskar refers to the moral and ethical mannerism that an individual learns in his or her early years of life. The significance of education-sanskar in human lives are follows:
- Correct Identification of our Aspirations: It allows us to correctly understand our needs and visualise our goals, as well as indicate the direction for their fulfilment. It also aids in the removal of our ambiguities and contradictions, bringing harmony on all levels.
- Understanding Universal Human Values to Fulfill our Aspirations in Continuity: Values serve as the foundation for all of our thoughts, behaviours, and actions. When we know what is important to us, we can use that knowledge to guide our actions.

This is referred to as the value domain, and when we learn and practice to achieve this goal, we develop the techniques to make it happen in real life. This is referred to domain of skills.
- Evaluation of our Beliefs: Each of us has certain beliefs that we base our values on, which may or may not be true in reality. It aids in the evaluation of our beliefs and assumed values.
- Technology and Human Values: The current educational system is largely skill-based. The primary focus is on science and technology. A critical component of the current educational system is value education. Because of this deficiency, most of our efforts may be counterproductive, and serious crises at the individual, societal, and environmental levels are manifesting.

- Understanding Universal Human Values to Fulfill our Aspirations in Continuity: Values serve as the foundation for all of our thoughts, behaviours, and actions. When we know what is important to us, we can use that knowledge to guide our actions.
- Complimentarity of Values and Skills: To achieve goals, both values and skills are required. When we set the right goals and take the right steps. This is referred to as the value domain, and when we learn and practice to achieve this goal, we develop the techniques to make it happen in real life. This is referred to domain of skills.
- Evaluation of our Beliefs: Each of us has certain beliefs that we base our values on, which may or may not be true in reality. It aids in the evaluation of our beliefs and assumed values.
- Technology and Human Values: The current educational system is largely skill-based. The primary focus is on science and technology. A critical component of the current educational system is value education. Because of this deficiency, most of our efforts may be counterproductive, and serious crises at the individual, societal, and environmental levels are manifesting.

The next time you are teaching a lesson, count how many questions students are asked.
When students are herded and corralled into the narrow chute of standardized testing, they are so heavily indoctrinated with fear of failure that only a fool would dare venture off the beaten path. We are, after all, talking about young people, and can hardly expect them to rebel against it (considering this may make you rethink those students who actually do). The consequences of straying are so fierce: the promise of no job; the shame of failure; the ire of the school. It is no wonder then that students are afraid to take risks and think for themselves, and why inevitably so many unnecessary questions are asked.
To add insult to injury, when governments decide in their wisdom that the solution to ensuring progress in education is to standardize testing even more, they force schools to constrict curricula further. They reduce the opportunities to explore creativity in subjects. They trim a course down to its quantitative shell, and by doing so reduce a student’s opportunities to develop problem-solving strategies. Essentially, they force schools to produce hydroponic students.
Teaching Students In Authentic Contexts
Whilst using hydroponics to grow fruit and vegetables seems like the golden ticket to solving the world’s food problems, the method, while yielding ostensibly larger and faster produce, is significantly flawed in three ways: first, the final product lacks real nutrient and substance, and ultimately taste.
Secondly, the plant itself grows in a very unnatural and toxic state, absorbing inordinate quantities of chemicals and pesticides to control it at every turn, which must affect its overall enjoyment in growing, and thirdly, once the plant is gone and the process is over, it leaves no positive legacy – in fact, it depletes the ground around it. When students are taught in unnatural conditions, with the sole purpose of producing quantifiable results, they too suffer in three similar ways:
First, when they finish their education with a whole lot of credentials, (if they have managed to get through the system), they may lack any real depth of knowledge and any ability to problem solve. This is because the learning has been too shallow, only concentrating on aspects of a course that need to be learned for standardized testing. Like the roots of the hydroponic plant, the brain’s synapses aren’t encouraged to expand and strengthen because there isn’t any opportunity or need to do so. The more prescriptive the learning, the less chance the student has to wander off the path, and get dirty, and find solutions to get out of the mud. Necessity is the mother of invention, but when students aren’t ever given such chances, they lose the capacity to think on their feet, and eventually, to think for themselves in most situations.
Secondly, if students are encased day after day in the confines of the school building, seated for extraordinary long periods of time in rows of desks, and ushered from class to lunch to class under the strict timings of bells, the process of distancing the young from their natural condition is well underway. If students are doused with pointless and irrelevant information disguised as learning, it is obvious that they won’t enjoy school.
Even well-meaning teachers can fall foul to the system, themselves operating in fear of not covering the required territory. In fact, it’s an impossible feat to teach the amount of stipulated material of most subjects to any level of depth to the average class. To curb the natural inclination of students to disengage in such a learning context, schools superficially inoculate their students with countless tirades, warning against disengagement and punishing culprits in attempts to quell it. It is no wonder that students can feel that their paths in learning and growth have become stifled and one-directional and oppressed. It is no wonder they rarely if ever connect learning with happiness.
Thirdly, because of the shallowness of the learning required for standardized tests, and the lack of base in the knowledge creation, the transference of the learning into new contexts is limited. The process yields little reward after the examination period, and does little to sustain the learner, or indeed the community around him or her. The student raised in the hothouse of standardized testing struggles to think outside the box, to solve new problems and ultimately flourish and contribute to a rapidly changing 21st century world.","What are some potential strategies to promote student engagement in a science project that focuses on sustainable urban planning, and how can these strategies be adapted to accommodate students with diverse learning needs?","To promote student engagement in a science project on sustainable urban planning, potential strategies include project-based learning, developing in-classroom strategies for improving engagement, and using the 5E model.

So just picking up on what Nancy said we have been actually used virtual reality perhaps people pick up on like it's a new thing. But I've been working in virtual reality for over 20 years and special schools, which students with autism, there's a really strong evidence base, but Nancy might be right that's in the academic community. So we know that virtual environments have been used to teach independent living skills to students with learning disabilities, employment skills, but it can also augment cognitive skills, such as working memory, choice, reaction time, independent decision making. That's all in the academic literature. So now that we have the second, it's actually the third or fourth wave of virtual reality. So we have headsets like the Oculus quest, for 400 pounds wireless, you can have incredible virtual experiences. But there's also the evidence base of perhaps our challenge in academia, is join with government organisations and join with Nesta as well to actually get that information that evidence base as teachers in terms of what works in terms of game making virtual environments. And in terms of robotics as well, where we've all had positive European projects, which show those technologies can teach skills, but they can also engaging people and encourage collaboration and better behavior. So I think perhaps the challenge is universities to work with government and non government organisations now to get that information to teachers, because there's a lot of evidence already existing about what works and what doesn't work. So we need to augment the evidence base and build it as well.
And to go to James's question, and this just pops up I have a I could associate it with quite a lot I'm of the generation and where the interactive whiteboard was rolled out in every classroom across the country, before very swiftly Blackboard in front of it, because the teacher had no idea how to use it. And if they did, add very little value to the classroom anyway, at least that was my, my experience. So I would I would I would repeat everything that's been said about the need, actually for schools and colleges universities to be supported. I would I would pose the question of who is curating the knowledge, who is curating the pedagogy and all the different things that are going on in the system. You know, you look at other professions, like, you know, in medicine, you have the BMA, they'll curate that. So I think there is a role here for the College of teaching, to actually step up and start playing that role and curating the knowledge crazy understanding. And I would point to one of the most fascinating examples of this in Japan, but their entire co equivalent of Ofsted and their framework actually has it built into it collaboration to teachers and schools are actually rewarded for sharing lesson plans for sharing what works and things like that. So I would pose the question of, you know, why do we have a body this kind of purpose is to curate, the knowledge and the system and to sort of spread breath practice. Why don't we have like the rest of the economy out of the country, we have a 2.4% R&D investment target as a country? Why do we not have a 2.4% equivalent target actually in pedagogy in education, where we are investing in research as a country, about these new methods.
That's a fantastic note on which to end this panel. And I genuinely think that maybe the education endowment foundation might be the organisation that could pick that up and curate that. And the beauty of this event is that the ideas that are generated here will be taken forward. So you heard it here first, a teaching toolkit from the education endowment foundation. I'm signing them up to it now about effective use of technology. Can I thank you for your involvement. And also add my thanks to yours for the panel.

But I've been working in virtual reality for over 20 years and special schools, which students with autism, there's a really strong evidence base, but Nancy might be right that's in the academic community. So we know that virtual environments have been used to teach independent living skills to students with learning disabilities, employment skills, but it can also augment cognitive skills, such as working memory, choice, reaction time, independent decision making. That's all in the academic literature. So now that we have the second, it's actually the third or fourth wave of virtual reality. So we have headsets like the Oculus quest, for 400 pounds wireless, you can have incredible virtual experiences. But there's also the evidence base of perhaps our challenge in academia, is join with government organisations and join with Nesta as well to actually get that information that evidence base as teachers in terms of what works in terms of game making virtual environments. And in terms of robotics as well, where we've all had positive European projects, which show those technologies can teach skills, but they can also engaging people and encourage collaboration and better behavior. So I think perhaps the challenge is universities to work with government and non government organisations now to get that information to teachers, because there's a lot of evidence already existing about what works and what doesn't work. So we need to augment the evidence base and build it as well.
And to go to James's question, and this just pops up I have a I could associate it with quite a lot I'm of the generation and where the interactive whiteboard was rolled out in every classroom across the country, before very swiftly Blackboard in front of it, because the teacher had no idea how to use it. And if they did, add very little value to the classroom anyway, at least that was my, my experience. So I would I would I would repeat everything that's been said about the need, actually for schools and colleges universities to be supported. I would I would pose the question of who is curating the knowledge, who is curating the pedagogy and all the different things that are going on in the system. You know, you look at other professions, like, you know, in medicine, you have the BMA, they'll curate that. So I think there is a role here for the College of teaching, to actually step up and start playing that role and curating the knowledge crazy understanding. And I would point to one of the most fascinating examples of this in Japan, but their entire co equivalent of Ofsted and their framework actually has it built into it collaboration to teachers and schools are actually rewarded for sharing lesson plans for sharing what works and things like that. So I would pose the question of, you know, why do we have a body this kind of purpose is to curate, the knowledge and the system and to sort of spread breath practice. Why don't we have like the rest of the economy out of the country, we have a 2.4% R&D investment target as a country? Why do we not have a 2.4% equivalent target actually in pedagogy in education, where we are investing in research as a country, about these new methods.
That's a fantastic note on which to end this panel. And I genuinely think that maybe the education endowment foundation might be the organisation that could pick that up and curate that. And the beauty of this event is that the ideas that are generated here will be taken forward. So you heard it here first, a teaching toolkit from the education endowment foundation. I'm signing them up to it now about effective use of technology. Can I thank you for your involvement. And also add my thanks to yours for the panel.

Note: The question does not mention ""virtual reality"" or ""robotics"" directly, but requires knowledge of these topics to answer.","The final answer to the original input question is:

A university-school collaboration project, supported by government funding, can effectively utilize virtual reality and robotics in teaching students with autism to make informed decisions about their daily routines by designing a comprehensive system that incorporates both technologies. This system can be implemented in a robot-enhanced classroom, where students can interact with virtual reality experiences and robots that demonstrate body language and nonverbal cues. The virtual reality experiences can be designed to teach social, behavioral, and life skills, while the robots can be programmed to provide personalized support and feedback to the students. The implementation of this system can be facilitated by researchers and educators working together to develop and refine the technology, and by providing training and support to teachers and staff on how to effectively use the system in the classroom.","['https://floreovr.com/', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8870236/', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/14/business/virtual-reality-autism-children-telehealth-floreo.html', 'https://luxai.com/blog/robot-for-autism-hardware-design/', 'https://news.mit.edu/2018/personalized-deep-learning-equips-robots-autism-therapy-0627', 'https://luxai.com/robot-for-teaching-children-with-autism-at-home/', 'https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10639-020-10392-0', 'http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8466148/', 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34714733/', 'https://cas.okstate.edu/computer_science/vrice/dr_cecil_profile.html', 'https://education.ufl.edu/faculty/newbutt-nigel/', 'https://herbergerinstitute.asu.edu/about/venues-facilities/mix-center', 'https://education.ufl.edu/eltl/research/', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11010416/', 'https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2024-93077-001', 'https://education.ufl.edu/eltl/research/', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8115541/', 'https://education.ufl.edu/eltl/our-work/']",education

This conversation is chaired by Andy Mellor (National Immediate Past President, NAHT), with panellists Nancy Wilkinson (Senior Programme Manager, Nesta), Professor David Brown (Professor of Interactive Systems for Social Inclusion, Nottingham Trent University) and John Cope (Head of Education & Skills Policy, Confederation of British Industry). This panel discussion was recorded live on 14th November 2019, in the Main Stage of the Schools & Academies Show at the NEC in Birmingham.
Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome to our next session, our panel session on technology and the role of technology in improving social mobility. So we've had to just begin by asking everybody to introduce themselves and just say a little bit about who they are, where they're from.
So I'm Nancy Wilkinson, and I work at an organisation called Nesta. So Nesta is an innovation foundation, which basically means we try and work on different problems particularly to do with social good and we find new ways of doing tackling those. And education is a real focus for us in our organisation. And I'll tell you in a second, a little bit about some of our work that we're doing on edtech. But a bit about my background. So I have worked in education policy for the last eight years, and I'm now leading our work at Nesta on education technology. I'm also a school governor in a small Primary School in Tower Hamlets in London. So I see as well as some of the day to day challenges of working with schools, particularly from disadvantaged communities. So just very briefly on Nesta's work in edtech. So we working in partnership with the Department for Education, to help schools and colleges make more effective use of technology. We think it has some real potential to do some great things in our education sector, but it often doesn't live up to expectations, it can often be difficult to use. It's difficult for schools to know what to choose that's right for them. So we have two programs that we're working on. One is a grant funding program, which we announced yesterday, some of the winners of that grant funding, which are all digital tools that we think can be really helpful for schools and teachers, particularly in tackling teacher workload. And the second half of our program is our edtech innovation testbed. So that's an opportunity for schools and colleges to take part in trying out technology for free with working with an external evaluator to really get to grips on what's working so we can get some better evidence for what's out there. So this is my tiny plug. Applications for schools and colleges are open now. So if anyone has any questions about that specifically, you can find me afterwards but yeah, really excited for the discussion. Thank you.

So good afternoon. My name is David Brown. I'm Professor of interactive systems for social inclusion at Nottingham Trent University. I'm principal investigator for three European and I said European grants. One is to use machine learning and artificial intelligence to create personalised learning systems for students with autism and learning disabilities. But also for students in higher education, you might be surprised to find that students in higher education aren't always engaged in the learning process. So I've developed projects on educational robotics on serious games, and more recently on digital game based making as well, not just using games, but making games as well. More recently, we have another ESRC funded project. And I'm looking at the well being of young students in education. So again, we use sensor data that might be we're co creating objects, which are networked that children use in schools and the sensor data that can interpret their level of anxiety and we can then introduce non medicalised approaches to intervene.

So I have worked in education policy for the last eight years, and I'm now leading our work at Nesta on education technology. I'm also a school governor in a small Primary School in Tower Hamlets in London. So I see as well as some of the day to day challenges of working with schools, particularly from disadvantaged communities. So just very briefly on Nesta's work in edtech. So we working in partnership with the Department for Education, to help schools and colleges make more effective use of technology. We think it has some real potential to do some great things in our education sector, but it often doesn't live up to expectations, it can often be difficult to use. It's difficult for schools to know what to choose that's right for them. So we have two programs that we're working on. One is a grant funding program, which we announced yesterday, some of the winners of that grant funding, which are all digital tools that we think can be really helpful for schools and teachers, particularly in tackling teacher workload. And the second half of our program is our edtech innovation testbed. So that's an opportunity for schools and colleges to take part in trying out technology for free with working with an external evaluator to really get to grips on what's working so we can get some better evidence for what's out there. So this is my tiny plug. Applications for schools and colleges are open now. So if anyone has any questions about that specifically, you can find me afterwards but yeah, really excited for the discussion. Thank you.
Professor David Brown
So good afternoon. My name is David Brown. I'm Professor of interactive systems for social inclusion at Nottingham Trent University. I'm principal investigator for three European and I said European grants. One is to use machine learning and artificial intelligence to create personalised learning systems for students with autism and learning disabilities. But also for students in higher education, you might be surprised to find that students in higher education aren't always engaged in the learning process. So I've developed projects on educational robotics on serious games, and more recently on digital game based making as well, not just using games, but making games as well. More recently, we have another ESRC funded project. And I'm looking at the well being of young students in education. So again, we use sensor data that might be we're co creating objects, which are networked that children use in schools and the sensor data that can interpret their level of anxiety and we can then introduce non medicalised approaches to intervene. So we're looking at personalised learning systems, virtual reality, augmented reality, robotics, game making, and well being.","How might the Department for Education's EdTech grants for schools improve the overall effectiveness of teacher professional development programs in disadvantaged schools?

Your active participation is essential to create a real harmony between family education and school education. Naturally, this creates a relationship of trust and dialogue between the educational team and you as parents.
Our project is to be a school that makes all its pupils succeed, without forgetting that there are diverse successes and diverse paths to fulfilment.

IN cycle 3
In the in-depth cycle, our objective is for each student to communicate, read, write, create and become a citizen:
to make people want to read by offering a varied choice of books, by going to the library, by explaining the choice of book, by being a reader for the little ones
to encourage writing by creating a newspaper about cultural activities or outings and by using computers
encourage self-expression by participating in group debates, presenting and critiquing presentations, taking part in competitions or ‘outside’ events
reading a children’s newspaper
cultural outings: visits to museums, theatres, concerts, etc.

respect for collective material
respect of the given word
politeness: speaking and respecting others’ words

In order to achieve these objectives and to succeed in the mission of giving your child a complete education in accordance with our values, we have set up a pedagogical organisation to respond to the diversity of the students.
Within each class, the teacher in charge proposes :
We are aware that it is important for you, as parents, to have a clear and regular overview of the progress of your children’s work. To this end, we have set up a personalised follow-up during the school year. This is structured as follows:
IN cycle 1
We start in the kindergarten section, where a personal follow-up is set up for your child.
Your child receives an evaluation booklet at the end of the year which shows what he/she has learned and what he/she still needs to learn or is learning.
IN cycles 2 et 3
The graded assessment is implemented, which allows your children to be assessed according to the objective of the common base of knowledge.
These graded assessments are included in the report cards which will be given to you every six weeks and before each school holiday.
The need for an alternative approach to measuring your child’s personal development is appreciated and assessed in the skills booklet given to families.
Our experience has shown us that if a child’s success is visible through his good grades and his motivation to go to school, it can only really be measured at the end of his physical, intellectual and spiritual development. Their capacity for adaptability and openness to the world will enable them to become the citizens of tomorrow with confidence.

THE MEANS USED
In order to achieve these objectives and to succeed in the mission of giving your child a complete education in accordance with our values, we have set up a pedagogical organisation to respond to the diversity of the students.
Within each class, the teacher in charge proposes :
We are aware that it is important for you, as parents, to have a clear and regular overview of the progress of your children’s work. To this end, we have set up a personalised follow-up during the school year. This is structured as follows:
IN cycle 1
We start in the kindergarten section, where a personal follow-up is set up for your child.
Your child receives an evaluation booklet at the end of the year which shows what he/she has learned and what he/she still needs to learn or is learning.
IN cycles 2 et 3
The graded assessment is implemented, which allows your children to be assessed according to the objective of the common base of knowledge.
These graded assessments are included in the report cards which will be given to you every six weeks and before each school holiday.
The need for an alternative approach to measuring your child’s personal development is appreciated and assessed in the skills booklet given to families.
Our experience has shown us that if a child’s success is visible through his good grades and his motivation to go to school, it can only really be measured at the end of his physical, intellectual and spiritual development. Their capacity for adaptability and openness to the world will enable them to become the citizens of tomorrow with confidence.
In educating the young people entrusted to us in the Truth, Beauty, Goodness and Justice, it is the light of Jesus Christ that illuminates the character of our school.
This is the project that we want to live in our school.","How can the school's emphasis on ""making people want to read"" in Cycle 2 be adapted to accommodate students with dyslexia, while still maintaining the overall goal of fostering a love of reading?

"The philosophy and spirit of Notre-Dame Saint-Roch School is oriented towards a global education that includes knowledge and values. To achieve this, we want to offer a school that educates as well as teaches.
As parents, you are the first educators of your children: the responsibility for educational training lies partly with the school, but it can only complement what each child receives at home. Your active participation is essential to create a real harmony between family education and school education. Naturally, this creates a relationship of trust and dialogue between the educational team and you as parents.
Our project is to be a school that makes all its pupils succeed, without forgetting that there are diverse successes and diverse paths to fulfilment.
We take into account and scrupulously respect the official instructions and the programs established by the National Education, and within this framework our project is to :

"Further Education Pathways
For students who have performed well in the FTNA, there are a number of further education pathways available to them. These include continuing on to Form Three and Four, which lead to the completion of Ordinary Level Secondary Education. From there, students can choose to pursue Advanced Level Secondary Education, vocational training, or higher education at a college or university.
However, for students who have not performed well on the FTNA, their options for further education may be limited. They may need to repeat Form Two or seek alternative pathways to achieve their educational goals. It is important for students and parents to understand the implications of exam results and to seek guidance from teachers and counselors to help make informed decisions about their educational future.
Government Policy on Education
The results of the FTNA also have implications for government policy on education. The government can use the results to identify areas of strength and weakness in the education system and to develop policies and programs to address these issues. For example, if the results show that students in certain regions or schools are consistently underperforming, the government may allocate additional resources to these areas to improve educational outcomes.
Additionally, the government may use the results to evaluate the effectiveness of existing policies and programs. If the results show that certain policies or programs are not achieving their intended outcomes, the government may need to make changes to improve their effectiveness.
In summary, the release of the Form Two National Assessment (FTNA) exam results for the academic year 2023/2024 in Songwe Region has significant implications for students, parents, and the education system as a whole. It is important for all stakeholders to understand the implications of exam results and to use them to make informed decisions about further education pathways and government policy on education.

"Further Education Pathways
For students who have performed well in the FTNA, there are a number of further education pathways available to them. These include continuing on to Form Three and Four, which lead to the completion of Ordinary Level Secondary Education. From there, students can choose to pursue Advanced Level Secondary Education, vocational training, or higher education at a college or university.
However, for students who have not performed well on the FTNA, their options for further education may be limited. They may need to repeat Form Two or seek alternative pathways to achieve their educational goals. It is important for students and parents to understand the implications of exam results and to seek guidance from teachers and counselors to help make informed decisions about their educational future.

"By the Greek word paradigm (example) we mean a pattern or example to be followed in a given situation. The American physicist and philosopher Thomas Samuel Kuhn (1922-1996) defines paradigms as “scientific advances that generate models that, for a period of time, guide the subsequent development of research that provides solutions to the problems presented.” The educational paradigm is a model used in education and aims to find the most appropriate way to teach the new generations, which differs from that of the previous generations.
In his nineteenth-century magnum opus, Arthur Schopenhauer notes the idea that all truths go through three stages: in the first they are met with ridicule, in the second they encounter violent resistance, and in the third they are accepted. Decades later, and not entirely unrelated, H.F. Lovecraft for the first time defines the fear of the unknown as a fundamental fear, seeing it as the oldest and strongest of all fears.
The lifespan of all readers of this review, regardless of their generational affiliation, is characterized by daily radical changes and re-reminders of the views of these thinkers. Inevitably, one of the most vivid examples of the rise of the new and the unknown is the dizzying advances in information technology and digital transformation. In the era of technocapitalism and accelerating globalization, digitalization is increasingly being treated as a paradigm for reformulating human value systems and needs. In that sense, the digital transformation in the field of education is a paradigm of teaching reforms and an answer to the question of how to learn in the future.
The recently adopted educational reforms, which go beyond the “one subject-one textbook” principle and instead provide for the practice of open educational resources and the transition of didactic materials from printed to digital format, probably confirm the mentioned philosophical insights. The reactions of resistance, directed mainly to the digitalization of textbooks, are numerous and, of course, expected and understandable: finally, this reform is deep and far-reaching and with its sharpness and novelty undermines the traditional way of learning for decades based in our educational worldview. However, although some of the criticisms must be considered as a quality introduction to a constructive discussion on the digitalization of textbooks, many of the reactions come down to emotional tirades without much argument.
However, the efforts to refute and reason the unargued reactions must start with a reasoned approach and proven and solid postulates, because only in this way these modern and extremely positive educational reforms will gain legitimacy before the citizens who are affected. In that direction, it is necessary for the entire planning process to be realized with a multi-perspective approach.
The Ministry of Education and Science should present a detailed assessment of the envisaged technical and infrastructural challenges and concrete proposals for overcoming them. At the same time, a sound plan is needed for the dynamics of the implementation of this reform. Of course, the support of teachers is of great importance in this process, who, as direct implementers of change, should be provided with adequate preparation and training for professional development, including the reform of the relevant university curricula for the education of future teachers.
These goals are high and, in order to achieve them, the Government of the Republic of Northern Macedonia will have to offer more than declarative support for the reforms in the overall education. The fact that, according to a number of measurable indicators, the country has one of the lowest budgeted education systems in Europe, and arguably the most unfavorable results in international testing, is a sufficient indicator of the level of commitment required in primary, secondary and higher education. to increase confidence in progressive change and to more easily see all the benefits that modernization brings.

"By the Greek word paradigm (example) we mean a pattern or example to be followed in a given situation. The American physicist and philosopher Thomas Samuel Kuhn (1922-1996) defines paradigms as “scientific advances that generate models that, for a period of time, guide the subsequent development of research that provides solutions to the problems presented.” The educational paradigm is a model used in education and aims to find the most appropriate way to teach the new generations, which differs from that of the previous generations.
In his nineteenth-century magnum opus, Arthur Schopenhauer notes the idea that all truths go through three stages: in the first they are met with ridicule, in the second they encounter violent resistance, and in the third they are accepted. Decades later, and not entirely unrelated, H.F. Lovecraft for the first time defines the fear of the unknown as a fundamental fear, seeing it as the oldest and strongest of all fears.
The lifespan of all readers of this review, regardless of their generational affiliation, is characterized by daily radical changes and re-reminders of the views of these thinkers. Inevitably, one of the most vivid examples of the rise of the new and the unknown is the dizzying advances in information technology and digital transformation. In the era of technocapitalism and accelerating globalization, digitalization is increasingly being treated as a paradigm for reformulating human value systems and needs. In that sense, the digital transformation in the field of education is a paradigm of teaching reforms and an answer to the question of how to learn in the future.
The recently adopted educational reforms, which go beyond the “one subject-one textbook” principle and instead provide for the practice of open educational resources and the transition of didactic materials from printed to digital format, probably confirm the mentioned philosophical insights. The reactions of resistance, directed mainly to the digitalization of textbooks, are numerous and, of course, expected and understandable: finally, this reform is deep and far-reaching and with its sharpness and novelty undermines the traditional way of learning for decades based in our educational worldview. However, although some of the criticisms must be considered as a quality introduction to a constructive discussion on the digitalization of textbooks, many of the reactions come down to emotional tirades without much argument.
However, the efforts to refute and reason the unargued reactions must start with a reasoned approach and proven and solid postulates, because only in this way these modern and extremely positive educational reforms will gain legitimacy before the citizens who are affected. In that direction, it is necessary for the entire planning process to be realized with a multi-perspective approach.
The Ministry of Education and Science should present a detailed assessment of the envisaged technical and infrastructural challenges and concrete proposals for overcoming them. At the same time, a sound plan is needed for the dynamics of the implementation of this reform. Of course, the support of teachers is of great importance in this process, who, as direct implementers of change, should be provided with adequate preparation and training for professional development, including the reform of the relevant university curricula for the education of future teachers.
These goals are high and, in order to achieve them, the Government of the Republic of Northern Macedonia will have to offer more than declarative support for the reforms in the overall education. The fact that, according to a number of measurable indicators, the country has one of the lowest budgeted education systems in Europe, and arguably the most unfavorable results in international testing, is a sufficient indicator of the level of commitment required in primary, secondary and higher education. to increase confidence in progressive change and to more easily see all the benefits that modernization brings.

"This discussion group will look at some of the questions we need to ask ourselves to evaluate the use of technology in the classroom and ensure that it is used to enhance teaching practice and improve the education of students.
All too often, the tools of educational technology are used to ‘drive‘ and define the educational enterprise. We use tools because we can and are expected to, rather than because they help us meet educational objectives. The means become the end. This workshop will, through its participants, identify and offer an educational critique of some current uses of technology. It will first ask participants to identify some examples of educational technology use. Then, in small groups, participants will develop some educational tasks with specified objectives, assumptions and learning outcomes, together with the technological tools that could be used to assist in this. We will then analyze and discuss these, paying particular attention to educational rationales for using the technology and the real contributions it can make to learning. The ultimate purpose is to develop simple classification systems designed to help educators make well-informed judgements of the educational value in using technology.
How is technology changing the way teachers teach and children learn in our schools today? What skills does a teacher need in this new technological world? Do we need to teach any facts when we can “Google” and find out anything we need to know in an instant? Mobile phones are computers with cameras, voice recorders, web browsers, radios, audio players, organisers, etc. Should school students be using them in class? And what about exams, should students be able to use computers in all exams?
This interactive workshop will give participants the opportunity to discuss these questions, to consider how technology is changing education and examine its impact on our schools.
Claude Alvares will take a two-hour interactive workshop on “Nurturing Creativity”. A fixed, unchanging curriculum (and hidden curriculum) requires certain things to be “done” to the student. The teacher is appointed to ensure that the content of the curriculum is somehow lodged into the students’ heads. A successful teacher for any school administration is anyone who can do this task most effectively. However, creativity by definition deals with open-ended ideas and concepts. This naturally is in huge conflict with pre-set courses and content where creativity is at a minimum since the task demanded is comprehension and retention (mugging, if we are to speak frankly). The formal school today is criticised – and rightly so – for killing creativity. Since a large number of youngsters are involved, creativity gets a bashing on a colossal scale. Teachers claim that they have no time for creativity issues since the business of education is certification. Schools certify acquisition of knowledge and have no scope for creating new knowledge. The challenge is: Can schools nurture creativity and how? Will schools always kill creativity because this is the way they are organised to function or is there a chance that we can ensure transmission of necessary social knowledge and skills while protecting and nurturing the creative mind?
Why am I learning? Why do I have to go to school? Have you ever asked yourselves these questions or heard your children ask you? Often parents, at a loss for words, may respond and say, “because everyone goes to school.” At TNS, the staff dissects these questions and gives children an opportunity to be involved in and, to some extent ‘direct‘ their own learning and apply it in meaningful ways. Through class videos and portfolios of real work, we will see constructivism at work and an opportunity to learn some of the basics of project-based learning to get you started within your own classroom, school or community. Two of TNS’s past projects will be highlighted and there will be videos demonstrating teaching and learning. Challenges of project-based learning will be highlighted to help participants understand and hopefully avoid obvious pitfalls.

All across the planet, from different latitudes where ZARZA has settled Engineers, we have received and developed significant experiences with institutions of all academic grades. Now we are currently working on complex virtual education models, entirely based on remote classes, remembering us how for over the past 10 years we have been implementing systems for schools, colleges and Institutions of Higher Education, to improve their users’ care and education.
Educational Technology has exploded since it’s early progress over half a century ago, being today a phenomenon that has completely reached our children and young people, who have changed pencil and paper for tablets and laptops, carrying with them powerful memories, instead of heavy books that compromised their backs plus other physical conditions.
Today, the Educational Technology’s promotion has succeeded in diversifying teaching with dynamic activities, covering more information in less time; as demanded by the world we live in now.
Challenges of Professionals, from traditional to digital
It is and has been extremely rewarding to participate in processes worldwide, when technologists, educators and ZARZA Engineers are raising successful strategies, mixing the added knowledge of generations of educators with the “new”, the digital, what keeps the attention of those who today are completely digital natives.
In this process, teachers and students are challenged to assume with positivism the change of a new era, when Educational Technology means so much emotion, as responsibility and willingness to do something good, something much better.
Among the organizational challenges there’s always the administration and monitoring of agendas and databases, as well as care of the contents accessible from the institution’s installations, being this an opportunity to address as a second home, social and communitary issues that used to pass completely unnoticed.

Understanding Different Ways to Change the World
There are various ways to create an impact on the world around us. This section will outline some main approaches that can bring about positive change, including social change, climate change, new technology, and campaigns and movements.
Social change is the transformation of culture and social institutions over time.
This can encompass shifts in public opinion, innovative solutions development, or even new social norms and values.
Examples of social change include the civil rights movement in the United States, the fight for gender equality, and efforts to decrease income inequality. Individuals and organizations can effectively foster social change by understanding the root causes, advocating for policies, and empowering communities.
Addressing climate change is a global priority, as its impact on the environment and society is far-reaching.
Understanding climate change’s causes and consequences is essential to enact meaningful change. Efforts include reducing greenhouse gas emissions by promoting alternative energy sources, implementing energy-efficient solutions, and adapting to the changing environment.
Collaborative initiatives, such as the Paris Agreement, aim to collectively mitigate the effects of climate change and transition towards a more sustainable future.
Technological advancements continually shape the way we live, work, and communicate. Leveraging new technology can have powerful implications for tackling global challenges and improving the world.
For example, innovations in clean energy technologies, such as solar panels and electric vehicles, reduce carbon emissions and promote sustainable practices. Additionally, advancements in healthcare technology can revolutionize medical treatments, enhance global health, and ultimately save lives.
- Clean energy: Solar panels, wind turbines, electric vehicles
- Healthcare: Artificial intelligence in diagnostics, telemedicine, gene editing
Campaigns and Movements
Campaigns and social movements have the potential to rally public support, influence policy, and create significant change.
These efforts may address various issues, such as environmental conservation, access to education, and human rights advocacy. Successful campaigns and movements often rely on strategic communication, grassroots activism, and coalition-building among diverse stakeholders.
Examples include the civil rights movement, the women’s rights movement, and the international campaign to ban landmines.
By exploring and employing different methods of change, individuals and organizations can make a tangible impact on the world around them and contribute to a more just, sustainable, and equitable future.
Personal Actions for Positive Impact

Note: This question requires expertise in empowering youth, technology, and social media, as well as the context of positive change and individual actions.","To effectively use social media to raise awareness about mental health issues among young people, we can utilize platforms such as Instagram, TikTok, and Snapchat, which are popular among this age group. We can create engaging content, such as videos, stories, and posts, that promote positive conversations and encourage young people to share their own experiences and stories. Additionally, we can partner with influencers and mental health organizations to amplify our message and reach a wider audience.

To measure the impact of these efforts, we can track metrics such as engagement rates, hashtag usage, and social media mentions. We can also conduct surveys and focus groups to gauge the effectiveness of our campaigns and identify areas for improvement. Furthermore, we can monitor changes in mental health-related conversations and hashtags over time to assess the overall impact of our efforts.","['https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6904320/', 'https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/sg-youth-mental-health-social-media-advisory.pdf', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7325786/', 'https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/15248399241232646', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7785056/', 'https://www.rsph.org.uk/about-us/news/instagram-ranked-worst-for-young-people-s-mental-health.html']",education

"That's reassuring as an educator. And I want to turn our attention a little bit to the issue of social mobility, because and there are really good examples out there of the way that that education technology can support the development of social mobility. And have you have you got anything to share with us in terms of examples that you might have come across?
I can give a couple of so I said that we've announced some funding for grantees edtech organisations that are working in a range of different areas. I think the first point I'd make is that usually, I think technology has a role to play in tackling social mobility where it supports great teaching. So I don't think technology on its own can do this. We were talking just before we started around a school, you mentioned in Blackpool that had really embedded iPads into their learning. And I'm sure there was some fantastic programs on that iPads that children could use, that teachers could use. But I guarantee that it wasn't that alone, that it was that those iPads were helping teachers teach brilliantly saving their time, so they had more time to put to the things that really mattered. So I think when we're talking about social mobility and technology, I do think it's essential that we're looking at technology as a support for great teaching and learning. Some of the tools I would say about actually as an example for for that I think there's we're working with organisations that are one trying to tackle formative assessment. So such an important element of teaching being able to give great feedback. So I was working with a few organisations that are supporting schools to save time on their assessment but also support great feedback. People like HegartyMaths is fantastic, Seneca, Pobble. All of these are working with schools to to kind of help that teaching process. Another really key element we think, is parental engagement. We speak to schools all the time. And I know from my own work as a school governor, how difficult it is to engage with some of those hard to reach parents, parents who might be working two jobs, who don't have normal working patterns, who might have had bad experiences with the education system. And we're exploring this with several organisations that are making it much easier for parents to access to access information about the school in a more accessible way. So an example on that is free flow info. So they work in a number of schools are doing things that are really different. So just different ways of engaging different kinds of parents. So I think that's another key one. And another thing you mentioned was accessibility. So we, I think one key thing is that all technology I think we've already heard should be accessible to all students. So students with learning difficulties often are left behind from technology products, which don't see it as their top priority. And I think it should be it should be a priority for every single technology product out there. And schools and people like us should be pushing them further to make sure that that is a key priority. And somebody who's here today actually, mangahigh, a maths assessment tool, and we're supporting them with some funding to make sure that everything that they have on offer can be ready and available for SEND schools. So a few examples, not too many plugs, I hope, some helpful advice as well.
Great. And obviously, you know, issues around social mobility, don't stop at the end of key stage four, you know, there will be same sort of issues in higher education whatsoever. How are you using technology to be able to support pupils who are disadvantaged in higher education?

These innovative approaches can help to ensure that teachers and parents of students with disabilities, particularly those with limited English proficiency, have the opportunity to communicate effectively and work together to support the student's education and well-being.","['https://www2.ed.gov/ocr/letters/colleague-el-201501.pdf', 'https://www.colorincolorado.org/article/communicating-important-information-ell-families-strategies-success', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8697718/', 'https://www2.ed.gov/ocr/letters/colleague-el-201501.pdf', 'https://www.parentcenterhub.org/special-factors/', 'https://www.education.pa.gov/Policy-Funding/BECS/PACode/Pages/EducatingELs.aspx', 'https://www2.ed.gov/ocr/letters/colleague-el-201501.pdf', 'https://www.colorincolorado.org/article/communicating-important-information-ell-families-strategies-success', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8697718/']",education
"That's reassuring as an educator. And I want to turn our attention a little bit to the issue of social mobility, because and there are really good examples out there of the way that that education technology can support the development of social mobility. And have you have you got anything to share with us in terms of examples that you might have come across?
I can give a couple of so I said that we've announced some funding for grantees edtech organisations that are working in a range of different areas. I think the first point I'd make is that usually, I think technology has a role to play in tackling social mobility where it supports great teaching. So I don't think technology on its own can do this. We were talking just before we started around a school, you mentioned in Blackpool that had really embedded iPads into their learning. And I'm sure there was some fantastic programs on that iPads that children could use, that teachers could use. But I guarantee that it wasn't that alone, that it was that those iPads were helping teachers teach brilliantly saving their time, so they had more time to put to the things that really mattered. So I think when we're talking about social mobility and technology, I do think it's essential that we're looking at technology as a support for great teaching and learning. Some of the tools I would say about actually as an example for for that I think there's we're working with organisations that are one trying to tackle formative assessment. So such an important element of teaching being able to give great feedback. So I was working with a few organisations that are supporting schools to save time on their assessment but also support great feedback. People like HegartyMaths is fantastic, Seneca, Pobble. All of these are working with schools to to kind of help that teaching process. Another really key element we think, is parental engagement. We speak to schools all the time. And I know from my own work as a school governor, how difficult it is to engage with some of those hard to reach parents, parents who might be working two jobs, who don't have normal working patterns, who might have had bad experiences with the education system. And we're exploring this with several organisations that are making it much easier for parents to access to access information about the school in a more accessible way. So an example on that is free flow info. So they work in a number of schools are doing things that are really different. So just different ways of engaging different kinds of parents. So I think that's another key one. And another thing you mentioned was accessibility. So we, I think one key thing is that all technology I think we've already heard should be accessible to all students. So students with learning difficulties often are left behind from technology products, which don't see it as their top priority. And I think it should be it should be a priority for every single technology product out there. And schools and people like us should be pushing them further to make sure that that is a key priority. And somebody who's here today actually, mangahigh, a maths assessment tool, and we're supporting them with some funding to make sure that everything that they have on offer can be ready and available for SEND schools. So a few examples, not too many plugs, I hope, some helpful advice as well.
Great. And obviously, you know, issues around social mobility, don't stop at the end of key stage four, you know, there will be same sort of issues in higher education whatsoever. How are you using technology to be able to support pupils who are disadvantaged in higher education?
Professor David Brown","What strategies would be effective in reducing the digital divide among students with disabilities in higher education, ensuring that they have equal access to online learning resources and course materials?","To effectively reduce the digital divide among students with disabilities in higher education, several strategies can be employed. These include providing accessible devices and internet access, offering digital literacy training, and implementing assistive technologies. Additionally, institutions can provide accommodations such as text-to-speech software, screen readers, and closed captions. Furthermore, faculty can be trained to use Universal Design for Learning (UDL) principles to create inclusive online courses.","['https://soeonline.american.edu/blog/digital-divide-in-education/', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10259090/', 'https://adata.org/research_brief/research-brief-digital-access-students-higher-education-and-ada', 'https://soeonline.american.edu/blog/digital-divide-in-education/', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10259090/', 'https://adata.org/research_brief/research-brief-digital-access-students-higher-education-and-ada', 'https://soeonline.american.edu/blog/digital-divide-in-education/', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10259090/', 'https://adata.org/research_brief/research-brief-digital-access-students-higher-education-and-ada']",education
"UNESCO data show that 20% of children ages 6 to 11 are out of school, and 60% of those above age 15 are excluded from the educational system. Many school systems have fees that are burdensome for families which, according to the World Bank, can lead to further exclusion. Students in rural areas face even more challenges: schools are harder to access, tend to have less infrastructure, and have fewer well-trained teachers. Sub-Saharan Africa is also host to a dazzling array of languages, which makes creating quality curricula a challenge.
Despite these challenges, this region is filled with driven innovators who recognise that access to quality education is a form of empowerment for both the children they help and the communities those children are in. Among the 2024 Global Collection, ACE Radio School, Shupavu291, TAW Academy’s Board Games, and Chalkboard Guides stand out as examples of how barriers can be broken down, education can be democratized, communities can be strengthened, and gaps can be bridged by using precisely chosen initiatives that are cost effective and respect local knowledge. So how can we leverage everyday tools - a radio, a text message, a chalkboard and a board game - to make a big impact?
Breaking Down Barriers
Eno Simon, Head of Office at ACE Charities, shows how the barriers to education can compound: “Nigeria has the highest rate of out-of-school children in the world. They’re out of school for so many reasons.… Even if you have traditional classroom education, families cannot pay the fees. They don’t feel safe letting their children go to school, and even when they get to school, sometimes you have poorly motivated teachers who don’t show up. And sometimes you don’t even have the resources.” Her team considered ways to make education accessible even in the face of these challenges. They needed an innovation that made quality education available - even free - to students while in the safety of their own homes.
ACE lessons take place in local communities and in local languages
Their solution? ACE Radio School, which brings school to their students, honouring their situations and giving them a space to continue their education. Eno explains: “We have provided access to quality learning that is free and safe because it happens in their local community, accessible by radio. Everybody has radio, even parents with regular phones have the radio component so they can access learning in their local languages.” The programme, which airs three times a week across four radio stations, hires teachers from the top private schools to formulate the lessons and has furnished education to nearly 36,000 students across 10 states.
But Eno emphasises that radio lessons are an opening: “We find an increased interest in formal education. Some people have been to school but they dropped out… But when the experience is radio school, it inspires their interest to go back to school.”
Of course, students who are in school need support as well. While teacher training improves, Shupavu291 and Chalkboard Guides take two different paths to democratising education.
In Kenya, mobile phone subscriptions are quite common - as of 2021 there are 1.25 mobile phone accounts per resident. Eneza Education realised that this could be an easy way to provide tutoring and educational content at low cost to their users. They paired with Safaricom to create Shupavu291, a mobile learning platform accessible entirely through SMS, with lessons, quizzes and assignments aligned to the Kenyan national curriculum. But they also have access to much broader support: students are matched to teachers who respond in real-time to their questions, and they can access Wikipedia by texting the platform for more information. The scale of this innovation is staggering: they have already delivered nearly 80 million lessons and the students who engage with them perform 23% higher on tests.
Lessons from Chalkboard Guides are rigorous and easy to follow for teachers and students
Shupavu291 provides students with high quality tutoring on demand. Chalkboard Guides, on the other hand, works to make classroom teaching more effective. Justice Rising’s Chief Technical Officer Ee-Reh Owo shares why an intervention in teaching methods is urgent: “It's well-known that too many children are not achieving basic literacy and numeracy. But in Sub-Saharan Africa, where according to the World Bank, 89% of 10 year olds cannot read and understand a simple text, students in conflict zones learn six times slower than even their peers who are affected by other types of crisis.” Justice Rising found that structured pedagogy solutions based on best practices were impactful in improving educational outcomes, but teachers did not have the bandwidth to properly implement them. Chalkboard Guides was developed with an eye to Cognitive Load Theory, which stresses the importance of predictable routines and learning in manageable chunks, especially during stressful situations.","How can policymakers balance the need for standardized curriculum with the importance of local language and cultural context in education, particularly in regions with high rates of out-of-school children and limited access to quality education?","Policymakers can balance the need for standardized curriculum with the importance of local language and cultural context in education by creating a supportive environment for learning, incorporating critical perspectives, and adapting curriculum policies to suit the local context.

"Professor David Brown
I think that's really true. That's a real potential downside of technology. Because every time we introduce new technology, virtual reality, AI machine learning, the money still tends to go to higher education. So I fight for money in Europe, to support technology in terms of educational technology for people with learning disabilities and autism. But still, the big money's still going to people who can afford to go to university. So social mobility in the past as we all know, was based on good education, and you can change your economic position or your social status. And when I went to university, I didn't have to take a loan. But now all of my students have to take a loan. And so what we're getting is people who can afford to pay afford to take the risk, and not people based on greatest merit. So I think it's a challenge to technologists, to create systems that are targeting people at risk of exclusion. And that's what we do. And there are good uses of virtual reality and AI, and machine learning, and you all know them. And we can also invest in good uses too. And that's what I think our aim should be, to address that point. There's a huge potential danger.
Do you want to chip in on that one?
I suppose, what I would add again, to go back to my high open, about employers have this duty to step up and get involved. And you know, thousands and thousands do is that is part of the solution. In the you know, we we spent a lot of our time encouraging our members to get involved and actually getting them to go to schools that need the help in college universities that need the help. So, you have phenomenons and I'm sorry to use a London example in Birmingham. But you know, you have a phenomenon where schools in Tower Hamlets will have bankers, accountants queuing up to help and there's a lot of their time to tell him to go away. And you then go only a half a mile down the road somewhere like Barking and there's nothing and actually it's very difficult for employers and charities to understand where are the cold spots as it were, how do you get your help to those that most needed not the ones that shout the loudest or are closest, so I was very struck actually by a speech by Damien Hinds when he when he was Secretary of State that he said that it when he first became Secretary of State, all of his civil servants planned out his diary to visit schools and colleges and all of the schools, colleges that he was visiting, were outstanding or good. And, I think there's a danger we all sort of slip into is that we will see the good, we will see the outstanding, and I hope whoever is the next Education Secretary will continue what Damien Hinds spoke about and actually commit entirely to helping the cold spots, not the official cold spots, which are somewhat arbitrary and somewhat confusing. The Northeast for instance, not having one despite having the highest of deprivation, but actually thinking about where the schools and colleges that need the most help, and how do we get the most money to them? How do we get employers to help them? And try to actually coordinate it because I, I think there is enough out there, there is you know, we spend above the average education. And we have very, very enthusiastic employers. And yet we still have disadvantaged gaps and other problems. So I think a huge part of the answers question is just better coordination, and focusing all the efforts as much as we can.","How might the incorporation of virtual reality technology into a university curriculum help to address the issue of students from disadvantaged backgrounds feeling less connected to the campus community and more likely to drop out?

The incorporation of virtual reality technology into a university curriculum can help address the issue of students from disadvantaged backgrounds feeling less connected to the campus community and more likely to drop out by providing them with a sense of belonging and connection to the educational community.

I think that's really true. That's a real potential downside of technology. Because every time we introduce new technology, virtual reality, AI machine learning, the money still tends to go to higher education. So I fight for money in Europe, to support technology in terms of educational technology for people with learning disabilities and autism. But still, the big money's still going to people who can afford to go to university. So social mobility in the past as we all know, was based on good education, and you can change your economic position or your social status. And when I went to university, I didn't have to take a loan. But now all of my students have to take a loan. And so what we're getting is people who can afford to pay afford to take the risk, and not people based on greatest merit. So I think it's a challenge to technologists, to create systems that are targeting people at risk of exclusion. And that's what we do. And there are good uses of virtual reality and AI, and machine learning, and you all know them. And we can also invest in good uses too.

"Even though the technology is beneficial, there are also some disadvantages to the concept. Have a look below:
1. Potential of Over-Reliance
The overuse of immersive learning technologies might hinder the growth of other abilities, including communication, critical thinking, and problem-solving. Being immersed in a virtual world puts expressions, body language and some other human cues on hindsight, making interactions lesser effective. This questions the stability of these virtual learning environments.
2. Highly Skilled Workforce
All types of immersive learning technologies are worked on and handled by highly experienced and skilled professionals. Consequently, without the people involved, these technologies would not be as effective in aiding any learning experience.
3. Learning Outcomes
Relying on immersive learning environments could cause students to get preoccupied with the devices rather than the learning process, making the learning process suffer. Moreover, there is no actual evidence that using immersive learning technologies improve learning outcomes or the process.
4. Safety Concerns
A virtual environment could cause certain users to experience physical or psychological harm, like nausea, migraines, dizziness, or balance problems. Virtual reality headsets, 3D glasses, controllers, or earbuds could also make you prone to pathogens that can spread between users who use the same devices. Moreover, some users claim that they experience momentary fuzziness, lightheadedness, or dream-like states after being immersed in a virtual environment.
5. Limited Real-World Applicability
Immersive learning experiences don't always translate to practical situations. These settings can be helpful for practice and feedback. Still, they might need to accurately reflect the complexity of actual situations. This may reduce how well the training prepares students for real-world job settings.
Best Practices for Effective Learning
Effective Learning with Immersive Learning in education is possible with the following practices:
1. Define Learning Objectives
Establishing the learning objectives in detail is crucial before developing an immersive learning experience. This will make it easier to ensure that the training aligns with the targeted results and that learners know what is expected of them. It will not only help in achieving your goals faster but also helps in testing your progress. You can also make a note of the time taken and techniques followed to achieve the task and improve it for further projects.
2. Include Interactivity
Utilize different learning modalities such as lectures, podcasts, videos, or interactive activities to reinforce key concepts. Interactive, immersive training in education is also a part of these modalities to promote the involvement and engagement of learners. This could involve simulations and situations that let students use their knowledge in a real-world setting and get rapid feedback.
3. Make it Realistic
The most natural settings should be used for creating immersive learning experiences. This can involve including true-to-life situations, simulations, and environments to aid learners in acquiring the abilities and information required to succeed in practical settings.
Make sure that the type of immersive learning experience you are offering for educational purposes is accessible to all. All learners, including those with disabilities, should be able to participate in immersive learning experiences. This can involve making the platform compatible with assistive technology and offering different formats for students with visual or aural impairments.
5. Include Social Learning Aspects
To encourage student cooperation and knowledge sharing, immersive learning should include social learning opportunities. This may entail including forums, collaborative projects, and peer review exercises.
Immersive Learning vs Experiential Learning
Immersive learning is an educational approach that immerses students in a virtual or physical environment that simulates real-world scenarios. It is designed to help learners better understand and retain information by actively engaging them in learning. Examples of immersive learning include virtual reality, augmented reality, and simulation-based learning.
Experiential learning is an educational approach that emphasizes the hands-on exploration of concepts and skills. It allows learners to apply knowledge and skills in a practical setting and explore real-world problems. Examples of experimental learning include field trips, problem-based learning, and internships.

"Even though the technology is beneficial, there are also some disadvantages to the concept. Have a look below:
1. Potential of Over-Reliance
The overuse of immersive learning technologies might hinder the growth of other abilities, including communication, critical thinking, and problem-solving. Being immersed in a virtual world puts expressions, body language and some other human cues on hindsight, making interactions lesser effective. This questions the stability of these virtual learning environments.
2. Highly Skilled Workforce
All types of immersive learning technologies are worked on and handled by highly experienced and skilled professionals. Consequently, without the people involved, these technologies would not be as effective in aiding any learning experience.
3. Learning Outcomes
Relying on immersive learning environments could cause students to get preoccupied with the devices rather than the learning process, making the learning process suffer. Moreover, there is no actual evidence that using immersive learning technologies improve learning outcomes or the process.
4. Safety Concerns
A virtual environment could cause certain users to experience physical or psychological harm, like nausea, migraines, dizziness, or balance problems. Virtual reality headsets, 3D glasses, controllers, or earbuds could also make you prone to pathogens that can spread between users who use the same devices. Moreover, some users claim that they experience momentary fuzziness, lightheadedness, or dream-like states after being immersed in a virtual environment.
5. Limited Real-World Applicability
Immersive learning experiences don't always translate to practical situations. These settings can be helpful for practice and feedback. Still, they might need to accurately reflect the complexity of actual situations. This may reduce how well the training prepares students for real-world job settings.
Best Practices for Effective Learning
Effective Learning with Immersive Learning in education is possible with the following practices:
1. Define Learning Objectives
Establishing the learning objectives in detail is crucial before developing an immersive learning experience. This will make it easier to ensure that the training aligns with the targeted results and that learners know what is expected of them. It will not only help in achieving your goals faster but also helps in testing your progress. You can also make a note of the time taken and techniques followed to achieve the task and improve it for further projects.
2. Include Interactivity
Utilize different learning modalities such as lectures, podcasts, videos, or interactive activities to reinforce key concepts. Interactive, immersive training in education is also a part of these modalities to promote the involvement and engagement of learners. This could involve simulations and situations that let students use their knowledge in a real-world setting and get rapid feedback.
3. Make it Realistic
The most natural settings should be used for creating immersive learning experiences. This can involve including true-to-life situations, simulations, and environments to aid learners in acquiring the abilities and information required to succeed in practical settings.
Make sure that the type of immersive learning experience you are offering for educational purposes is accessible to all. All learners, including those with disabilities, should be able to participate in immersive learning experiences. This can involve making the platform compatible with assistive technology and offering different formats for students with visual or aural impairments.
5. Include Social Learning Aspects
To encourage student cooperation and knowledge sharing, immersive learning should include social learning opportunities. This may entail including forums, collaborative projects, and peer review exercises.
Immersive Learning vs Experiential Learning
Immersive learning is an educational approach that immerses students in a virtual or physical environment that simulates real-world scenarios. It is designed to help learners better understand and retain information by actively engaging them in learning. Examples of immersive learning include virtual reality, augmented reality, and simulation-based learning.
Experiential learning is an educational approach that emphasizes the hands-on exploration of concepts and skills. It allows learners to apply knowledge and skills in a practical setting and explore real-world problems. Examples of experimental learning include field trips, problem-based learning, and internships.
Immersive learning primarily aims to provide learners with a realistic setting that simulates. real-world events. The goal is to assist learners in acquiring knowledge and skills in a secure and controlled environment, free of the risks associated with real-world circumstances.","What are the potential implications for IT infrastructure and network bandwidth when implementing a large-scale immersive learning program across multiple classrooms, and how can educators and administrators mitigate these challenges?

"- Fourth, create personal relevance. All students have individual interests: those things they come into your classroom caring about. They also have situational interests: the things they’re motivated to care about because of the enthusiasm and passion of their teachers and peers. Both these areas are rich sources of goals that help students understand the meaning behind their learning.
- Goal Setting in Action: Whether a student is interested in frogs, robotics, or videos and animation, finding ways to allow students to bring those interests with them into the classroom helps them connect with what they’re learning. The reading teacher who helped a student engage with his interest in frogs while learning valuable reading skills was creating personal relevance.
- Fifth, use student choice. While not all students will be ready to set their own goals today, the ultimate objective is that all students take control of what and how they learn. To get them there, provide students meaningful choices over the activities they engage in, the academic areas they focus on, or the ways they show mastery in a subject. With their personal goal in hand, a student can focus on their individual learning and over time build the ownership they need to continue learning over the course of their lifetime.
- Goal Setting in Action: Some examples of supporting student choice are active listening, allowing independent time for goal setting and reflection, and reminding students of the hard work and progress they’ve already achieved. Encouraging students to be part of creating their own goals and reflecting on those goals more deeply connects students to those goals.
In many ways, technology is the “force multiplier” that can make this all possible. A classroom with one or two educators can’t reasonably expect an adult to guide five to 10 different activities at once, all reaching students from where they are. Providing meaningful activities where students can self-direct their learning allows them to practice key knowledge, apply knowledge in new situations, and work with standards at greater complexity while freeing teachers to focus on students who most need direct intervention.
Starting with Small Steps
A school culture where all members are focused on helping students achieve meaningful and ambitious goals — what some researchers call “academic press” (Leithwood and Sun, 2018) — won’t emerge overnight. While changing a culture seems complicated, it really is nothing more than the sum of a thousand small actions that communicate a common message to students, teachers, and leaders.
Even if your classroom or school can’t take on a full goal-setting practice today, little changes like providing students with opportunities to break down academic standards into their own words, or to discuss their areas of focus for an academic year, can begin to plant a culture focused on student growth.
Workshops never begin with all their tools in exactly the right place. As you progress from beginner to expert in any craft, you find the tools and workstations that meet your needs, and the most effective workshop begins to take shape.
The workshop classroom will also emerge over time. As you go to find your tools, consider what your group of young makers is ready for, where their skills lie, and what they ultimately want to build. Combining these tools with the techniques that direct them toward the right ends will help make sure learning in your workshop creates growth, builds motivation, and reinforces student agency.

While changing a culture seems complicated, it really is nothing more than the sum of a thousand small actions that communicate a common message to students, teachers, and leaders.
Even if your classroom or school can’t take on a full goal-setting practice today, little changes like providing students with opportunities to break down academic standards into their own words, or to discuss their areas of focus for an academic year, can begin to plant a culture focused on student growth.
Workshops never begin with all their tools in exactly the right place. As you progress from beginner to expert in any craft, you find the tools and workstations that meet your needs, and the most effective workshop begins to take shape.
The workshop classroom will also emerge over time. As you go to find your tools, consider what your group of young makers is ready for, where their skills lie, and what they ultimately want to build. Combining these tools with the techniques that direct them toward the right ends will help make sure learning in your workshop creates growth, builds motivation, and reinforces student agency.

Denver, CO: Marzano Research Laboratory, 2009.","What are some effective ways to increase student enthusiasm for a new unit on environmental sustainability, considering that some students may have had negative experiences with environmental topics in the past?","To increase student enthusiasm for a new unit on environmental sustainability, considering that some students may have had negative experiences with environmental topics in the past, I would suggest the following strategies:

1. Start with a sense of place and connection: Involve students in community-based projects that allow them to take ownership of their environment and make a positive impact.
2. Address negative experiences: Encourage students to share their concerns and negative experiences with environmental topics, and work to address these issues in a constructive and respectful manner.
3. Use technology: Incorporate technology into the classroom to make learning more engaging and interactive.
4. Create a positive classroom environment: Use the physical environment of the classroom to create a welcoming and engaging space that promotes student morale and happiness.
5. Create a learning contract: Work with students to create a learning contract that outlines their goals and expectations for the unit, and provides a sense of ownership and agency.
6. Use real-world examples: Use real-world examples and case studies to illustrate the importance and relevance of environmental sustainability, and to show how students can make a positive impact.
7. Provide opportunities for student choice and autonomy: Allow students to choose topics or projects that align with their interests and passions, and provide opportunities for them to take ownership of their learning.
8. Celebrate successes: Celebrate the successes and achievements of students, and provide recognition and rewards for their efforts and progress.

By incorporating these strategies into the new unit on environmental sustainability, teachers can help to increase student enthusiasm and engagement, and provide a positive and empowering learning experience for all students.","['https://www.plt.org/educator-tips/top-ten-benefits-environmental-education/', 'https://www.linkedin.com/posts/chrisna-du-plessis-901348b_it-is-with-great-excitement-that-after-more-activity-7212469726545911812-N25e', 'https://poole.ncsu.edu/news/2020/05/05/poole-graduation-spotlight-nikki-hensley/', 'http://home.miracosta.edu/jturbeville/online%20student%20comments.htm', 'https://www.pca.state.mn.us/news-and-stories/what-you-can-do-about-air-pollution', 'https://ced.ncsu.edu/news/2021/10/21/why-is-it-important-for-students-to-feel-a-sense-of-belonging-at-school-students-choose-to-be-in-environments-that-make-them-feel-a-sense-of-fit-says-associate-professor-deleon-gra/', 'https://www.edutopia.org/blog/the-physical-environment-of-classrooms-mark-phillips', 'https://www.kodable.com/learn/7-strategies-to-increase-student-engagement-in-elementary-school', 'https://www.edutopia.org/blog/career-technical-education-versus-college-prep']",education
"Since a recent NAEP study has shown a tight correlation between vocabulary and reading comprehension, some of the challenges facing the U.S. today are to greatly reduce the number of families living in poverty, educate all parents and daycare caregivers about the importance of talking to children in meaningful ways from birth on, and bring equity to under-resourced schools.
Poverty and achievement
It’s difficult to comprehend that the U.S., the wealthiest nation in the world, cannot significantly reduce the amount of poverty and raise the achievement levels of all children. Or that federal and state departments of education have failed to factor into their reform policies the significance of our high poverty rate, the lack of equity in education, and the relationship of poverty and inequity to children’s ability to learn and achieve.
Most of the lowest achieving schools in the U.S. have the highest number of disadvantaged students and are under-resourced. Yet, the thinking that is shaping education policy today seems to be that greater accountability, more “rigorous” curriculum standards, and tougher tests are sufficient to produce better teaching, higher test scores and “success for all.” Nowhere is the issue of poverty even acknowledged in current government initiatives.
Certainly the educators who work in state and federal education departments know better – many of them have worked in such communities and schools. But too often, a code of silence prevails in the face of misguided political decisions.
With the professed belief among policy makers and advisors that stricter accountability for teachers and administrators can reverse our downward reading-score trend, a national culture of blame and finger pointing has arisen. States have adopted regressive policies that tie teachers’ and administrators’ evaluations to students’ test scores, possibly affecting job security and punishing schools in high poverty communities by labeling them as “failing.”
Such accountability ignores the fact that every student can make progress, but not every student can meet the one-size-progress-for-all goal set by state departments of education. In this punitive and negative climate, it can become increasingly difficult to find teachers willing to work with English language learners, special education students, and high-poverty populations who can, and do, improve but often don’t meet mandated progress levels.
We admonish teachers to not teach to the test. Yet their evaluations of job performance depend on the annual test scores. So, of course teachers will teach to the tests, even though doing so adversely affects all children’s education by diminishing creative, innovative, and critical thinking.
Suppressing creative and critical thinking
At the College of William and Mary in Virginia, Dr. Kyung Hee Kim, an educational psychologist, started a study of creativity test results in 1990 and published her findings in 2011. Dr. Kim revealed a significant decrease in the creativity scores of children in kindergarten through grade six in the United States.
As Dr. Kim described in the 2012 Torrance Lecture at the University of Georgia College of Education, creativity scores, which had been on the rise prior to 1990 and prior to the No Child Left Behind and Reading First initiatives, have been steadily falling for the past two decades.
Dr. Kim’s study also showed that the relationship between IQ and creativity is small. According to Dr. Kim, creativity requires a climate and attitude where teachers and parents support students to play, explore new ideas, and experience a combination of convergent and divergent thinking.
Creative children can generate a wide range of ideas to solve problems. In particular, divergent thinking is the aspect of creativity that future generations will need to solve problems of war and genocide and fast-spreading diseases like Ebola.
The play and exploration in active learning environments that education philosopher and psychologist John Dewey described more than a century ago mirror the ways that children learn and develop creative, divergent thinking. It’s by doing, by pretending and role-playing, by listening to dozens of books read each day and discussing and dramatizing them, by engaging in meaningful conversations, by collaborative and generative problem solving, painting, dancing, and music, that children develop creativity.
With the onset of state and Common Core tests, our nation has adopted teaching practices that deter creative thinking and innovation. In an effort to improve reading scores, play as a way of exploring and learning has been greatly reduced in preschool. Instead, three- and four-year-olds spend their time learning the alphabet, studying letter-sound relationships and sight words, and developing phonemic awareness skills – in lieu of engaging in play as a way to understand concepts, group and classify items, and problem-solve.","How can policymakers design a national strategy to address the intersection of climate change and social inequality, taking into account the need for creative problem-solving and divergent thinking in addressing this complex issue?","To design a national strategy to address the intersection of climate change and social inequality, policymakers can incorporate creative problem-solving and divergent thinking into the decision-making process by considering the social dimensions of climate change and the need for gender equity and equality.

Note: The question does not mention creativity and education explicitly, but rather requires the teacher to think creatively and design a lesson that promotes exploration and learning.","The final answer to the question is:

To design a lesson that encourages children to explore and learn about plate tectonics in a way that fosters creativity and curiosity, a preschool teacher could consider the following ideas:

1. Use project-based learning: Provide children with a project that allows them to explore and learn about plate tectonics in a hands-on and creative way. For example, they could create a diorama of the Earth's surface, complete with moving plates and volcanoes.
2. Encourage curiosity: Encourage children to ask questions and explore the concept of plate tectonics in a way that fosters curiosity. For example, they could create a ""mystery box"" filled with different materials that represent different types of rocks and minerals, and challenge them to figure out what each one is and how it relates to plate tectonics.
3. Use storytelling: Use storytelling to help children understand the concept of plate tectonics. For example, they could create a story about a group of dinosaurs who lived on a continent that was moving towards a volcano, and how they had to adapt to the changing environment.
4. Incorporate art: Incorporate art into the lesson by having children create drawings or paintings of the Earth's surface, complete with moving plates and volcanoes. This can help them visualize the concept of plate tectonics and make it more engaging and memorable.
5. Use games: Use games to help children learn about plate tectonics in a fun and interactive way. For example, they could play a game where they have to move puzzle pieces around to create different landforms and plate boundaries.

By incorporating these ideas into the lesson, a preschool teacher can help children develop a deeper understanding of plate tectonics and encourage them to explore and learn about the concept in a way that fosters creativity and curiosity.","['https://www.caspercollege.edu/tate-geological-museum/curriculum/', 'https://www.musicforkiddos.com/blog/2019/5/1/spring-preschool-music-lesson-plan-going-on-a-picnic', 'https://blossomandroot.com/2017/09/how-i-plan-our-homeschool-week/', 'https://blog.acceleratelearning.com/25-preschool-stem-activities-with-inquiry-based-learning', 'https://blog.americansforthearts.org/2019/05/15/process-over-product-building-creative-thinkers-with-art', 'https://mybrightwheel.com/blog/engaging-outdoor-activities-for-preschoolers', 'https://thestay-at-home-momsurvivalguide.com/exploring-plate-tectonics-with-a-hands-on-puzzle/', 'https://rainydaymum.co.uk/edible-science-mountain-building-plate-tectonics-experiment/', 'https://wildearthlab.com/2023/10/18/plate-tectonics-activities/', 'https://rainydaymum.co.uk/edible-science-mountain-building-plate-tectonics-experiment/', 'https://teachbesideme.com/plate-tectonics-with-kinetic-sand/', 'https://www.caspercollege.edu/tate-geological-museum/curriculum/', 'https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/browse?search=plate%20tectonics%20project%20based%20learning', 'https://homeschoolrealm.com/my-new-experience-based-learning-system/', 'https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/browse?search=project%20based%20learning%20volcanoes', 'https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/browse?search=plate%20tectonics%20project%20based%20learning', 'https://www.nextgenscience.org/content/home-page', 'https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/browse?search=project%20based%20learning%20volcanoes', 'https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/browse?search=plate%20tectonics%20project%20based%20learning', 'https://www.nextgenscience.org/content/home-page', 'https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/browse?search=project%20based%20learning%20volcanoes']",education

Please note that the question does not mention ""imagination"" or ""creative development"", but it requires expertise in the subtopic to provide a comprehensive answer.","To develop a comprehensive curriculum for language learning that improves vocabulary, fosters critical thinking, and promotes empathy in students with limited exposure to diverse cultures, I would recommend the following approach:

1. Start by incorporating diverse cultural materials and resources into the curriculum, such as authentic texts, videos, and images that reflect the cultures and experiences of students from diverse backgrounds.
2. Use a backward design approach to plan the curriculum, starting with the end goal of language proficiency and cultural understanding, and working backward to identify the skills and knowledge students need to achieve that goal.
3. Incorporate strategies for fostering critical thinking and empathy, such as role-playing, debates, and discussions that encourage students to consider different perspectives and cultures.
4. Use technology and multimedia resources to provide students with opportunities to engage with diverse cultures and languages, such as virtual field trips, language exchange programs, and online cultural festivals.
5. Provide professional development opportunities for teachers to develop their own cultural competence and language teaching skills, and to learn how to incorporate diverse cultural materials and strategies into their teaching practices.
6. Encourage students to reflect on their own cultural backgrounds and experiences, and to share their perspectives and insights with their peers.
7. Incorporate assessments and evaluations that measure not only language proficiency, but also cultural understanding and empathy.

By incorporating these strategies and approaches into the curriculum, language learners can develop not only their language skills, but also their cultural competence and empathy, and become more effective communicators in a globalized world.","['https://www.doe.mass.edu/frameworks/world-languages/2021.pdf', 'https://www.education.pa.gov/Teachers%20-%20Administrators/Curriculum/WorldLanguages/Pages/default.aspx', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590291123003868', 'https://www.literacyworldwide.org/get-resources/resource-collections', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10054602/', 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17400201.2024.2347209?src=exp-la', 'https://study.com/academy/lesson/cultural-competency-in-curriculum-development.html', 'https://www.actfl.org/educator-resources/guiding-principles-for-language-learning/plan-with-backward-design', 'https://www.purdue.edu/innovativelearning/about-us/center-for-instructional-excellence-about/']",education
"I think this is a really interesting question. And if we take it, if we're thinking about schools at this point, the way I'll answer this question, I think one thing first to say is I don't actually think there's a danger that technology is going to replace teachers in our school system here. I don't think that's going to happen. And our research that we've done at Nesta doesn't show that it's likely, if anything, it shows that teaching is likely to be the occupation that's most likely to grow through as our world changes. So I think if we kind of agree that we're going to still have a system where every young every person of school age can go to school, for free in a state education system with teachers. You know, of course, so we have a recruitment crisis. So perhaps not enough teachers, but I still think that resource is always going to be there. But then I think the access to technology for school aged children is really about individual schools and deciding how to use their budget. So there's huge funding pressures. And so that is one key barrier for lots of schools is a decision as to whether to buy hardware for schools and what technology to provide to students. Some schools choose to do it and some don't. And I, you know, I won't talk too much about that. But I think it's kind of at a school level. And I think one of the key challenges here is the fragmentation of our system. It's really difficult for technology companies to navigate their way around the school system, going door to door almost every school in the country trying to sell their products. And it's very difficult for schools to get the value for money that they want from technology because they often operate on their own or in very small multi Academy trust. Obviously, there's some that are in larger trust that might have some ability, but actually most schools are In a situation where they're quite on their own and need much more support and advice on on kind of purchasing technology and getting the best value, because then actually all of those students in that school regardless of their background would have access to it. So a school level, I think that's really one of the challenges.
Yeah, and that touches very clearly doesn't hit on a couple of the questions that we've got there. In terms of, you know, you've got a limited budget, how do you create a digital learning space that you think is or that you know, is right? Without taking a punt on it, and who's there to advise? And, you know, I remember in the dim and distant past, Vector being around as well, and they were, they were a decent source of advice. They were a good go to people. But I dare say that you'd say Nesta, get Nesta involved?
Well, yeah, I think one of the key thing obviously, I say that one of the key things I would say that we're really trying to support schools with is the evidence base. So unfortunately, you know, I don't have the school's budget if I did, I would obviously use it in a different way. Maybe but you know, without us giving more money to schools, of course, that's not something I have control over. But what we're trying to do is make sure that there's really good evidence for what works in technology, so that schools don't waste their budgets on things that end up not fulfilling their promises that end up in a cupboard the next kind of year when the teachers change over. So it's about having a really good informed evidence base for what technology can work in what context and using that. So the edtech testbed that I mentioned previously is going to be producing a whole range of evidence and we hope to produce evidence in other ways, and find the best way of disseminating that for the school system. So that's something we're still exploring and if people have ideas of how schools and and and teachers really want to find out that information, how can we make it as easy as possible then we're really open to ideas about that as well, but it's something we're really keen on.
Professor David Brown","How can a school district balance the need for technology upgrades with the reality of limited budget resources, without compromising the quality of education provided to students?","One strategy for school districts to balance technology upgrades with limited budget resources is to prioritize and phase in upgrades, focusing on the most critical areas such as internet access and digital literacy. Another approach is to explore alternative funding sources, such as grants, public-private partnerships, and community fundraising efforts. Additionally, districts can consider upgrading existing technology infrastructure rather than replacing it entirely, and leveraging open-source or low-cost solutions.","['https://lizfarmer.substack.com/p/school-district-budget-deficits', 'https://www.vancopayments.com/education/blog/elementary-school-budgets', 'https://tech.ed.gov/files/2017/01/NETP17.pdf', 'https://mayor.dc.gov/release/mayor-bowser-presents-fiscal-year-2025-budget-proposal-fair-shot-strategic-investments-and', 'https://tech.ed.gov/files/2017/01/NETP17.pdf', 'https://www.vancopayments.com/education/blog/elementary-school-budgets', 'https://mayor.dc.gov/release/mayor-bowser-presents-fiscal-year-2025-budget-proposal-fair-shot-strategic-investments-and', 'https://tech.ed.gov/files/2017/01/NETP17.pdf', 'https://www.vancopayments.com/education/blog/elementary-school-budgets']",education
"I think this is a really interesting question. And if we take it, if we're thinking about schools at this point, the way I'll answer this question, I think one thing first to say is I don't actually think there's a danger that technology is going to replace teachers in our school system here. I don't think that's going to happen. And our research that we've done at Nesta doesn't show that it's likely, if anything, it shows that teaching is likely to be the occupation that's most likely to grow through as our world changes. So I think if we kind of agree that we're going to still have a system where every young every person of school age can go to school, for free in a state education system with teachers. You know, of course, so we have a recruitment crisis. So perhaps not enough teachers, but I still think that resource is always going to be there. But then I think the access to technology for school aged children is really about individual schools and deciding how to use their budget. So there's huge funding pressures. And so that is one key barrier for lots of schools is a decision as to whether to buy hardware for schools and what technology to provide to students. Some schools choose to do it and some don't. And I, you know, I won't talk too much about that. But I think it's kind of at a school level. And I think one of the key challenges here is the fragmentation of our system. It's really difficult for technology companies to navigate their way around the school system, going door to door almost every school in the country trying to sell their products. And it's very difficult for schools to get the value for money that they want from technology because they often operate on their own or in very small multi Academy trust. Obviously, there's some that are in larger trust that might have some ability, but actually most schools are In a situation where they're quite on their own and need much more support and advice on on kind of purchasing technology and getting the best value, because then actually all of those students in that school regardless of their background would have access to it. So a school level, I think that's really one of the challenges.

Professor David Brown","How can schools effectively allocate their budget to achieve a balance between investing in technology and providing adequate resources for extracurricular activities, given the potential benefits of both for student outcomes?","The final answer to the original input question is: To effectively allocate their budget, schools can consider implementing a tax credit system for extracurricular activities, as suggested by the search results. This could help allocate resources more efficiently.","['https://www.azauditor.gov/resources/school-districts/faqs', 'https://www2.uwstout.edu/content/lib/thesis/2009/2009wilsonn.pdf', 'https://www.vancopayments.com/education/blog/types-of-school-budgets', 'https://azdor.gov/tax-credits/public-school-tax-credit', 'https://www.azauditor.gov/resources/school-districts/faqs', 'https://azdor.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/PUBLICATION_guideline-public-school-ECA-tax-credit.pdf']",education
