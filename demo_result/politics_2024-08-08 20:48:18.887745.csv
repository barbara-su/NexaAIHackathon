"Federalism is a mode of administration that combines a single political system of the central or ""federal"" government with regional governments (provincial, state, cantonal, territorial, or other subunit governments). Its distinguishing feature initially embodied in the innovative system of government established by the United States Constitution of 1789, is a parity relationship between the two tiers of government. It is thus characterized as a type of governance in which powers are split between two equal levels of authority.
Federalism is distinct from confederalism, in which the general level of government is subservient to the regional level, and devolution within a unitary state, in which the regional level of government is subordinate to the general level. It is the primary form in the pathway of regional integration or separation, restricted on one side by confederalism and on the other by devolution within a unitary state. India, United States, Malaysia, Brazil, Mexico, Germany, Russia, Canada, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Switzerland, Argentina, Belgium, Pakistan, Nigeria, and Australia are examples of federations or federal states. Some regard the European Union as a forerunner to federalism in a multi-state setting, a concept known as the federal union of states.
Federalism and India
Federalism in India refers to the relation between India's Central Government and its state governments. The Indian Constitution establishes the framework of the Indian government. Part XI of the Indian constitution stipulates the division of legislative, administrative, and executive functions between the union government and the Indian states. The legislative powers are split into three lists: the Union List, the State List, and the Concurrent List, which represent the powers conferred on the Union government, the State governments, and the powers shared among them.
This federalism is symmetrical in the sense that the delegated powers of the constituent entities are envisioned to be the same. Because of an intentionally temporary section of the Indian Constitution known as Article 370, the state of Jammu and Kashmir has historically been afforded a different status than other states (which was revoked by the Parliament in 2019). Union territories are unitary in nature, ruled directly by the Union administration. Article 1 (1) of the constitution provides for two levels of government, with an extra local elected government. Articles 239AA and 239A granted legislatures to Delhi and Puducherry, respectively.
The Parliament of India, a bicameral legislature comprising the Rajya Sabha and the Lok Sabha, wields legislative powers. The Rajya Sabha (or the 'Council of States') is the upper house of parliament, consisting of members appointed by the president and elected by state and territorial legislatures. The Lok Sabha (also known as the 'House of the People') is the lower house. Because its legislation is subject to judicial review by the Supreme Court, the parliament does not have complete control and sovereignty.
It does, however, have some influence over the executive. Members of the Council of Ministers, including the Prime Minister, are either appointed by parliament or elected within six months of taking office. The Lok Sabha holds the council as a whole accountable. The Lok Sabha is a transitory house that can be dissolved only if the ruling party loses the support of a majority of its members. The Rajya Sabha is an indefinite house that can never be dissolved. The Rajya Sabha members are elected for a six-year tenure.
The constitution defines the distribution of powers, and legislative powers are separated into three lists:
Union List: The Union List consists of 100 items (up from 97 before) on which the parliament has sole legislative authority. Defence, armed forces, arms and ammunition, atomic energy, foreign affairs, war and peace, citizenship, extradition, railways, shipping and navigation, airways, posts and telegraphs, telephones, wireless and broadcasting, currency, foreign trade, inter-state trade and commerce, banking, insurance, industry control, regulation, and development of mines, mineral, and oil resources are all included.
State List: There are 61 items on the State List (earlier 66 items). Maintaining law and order, police forces, healthcare, transportation, land policies, energy in the state, village administration, and so on are all topics where uniformity is desirable but not required. The state legislature has sole authority to enact legislation on these topics. The Rajya Sabha (Council of States) must pass a resolution with a two-thirds majority that it is expedient to act in the national interest in order for the parliament to create legislation on subjects listed in the State List in specific circumstances. Though states have sole legislative authority over items on the State List, articles 249, 250, 252, and 253 provide circumstances in which the Union government may legislate.","How would an increase in the number of disputes between the Union Government and State Governments over the jurisdiction of certain laws impact the functioning of the Lok Sabha, considering the current distribution of powers?","The disputes between the Union Government and State Governments over the jurisdiction of certain laws could lead to a decrease in the functioning of the Lok Sabha, as it may result in a lack of consensus and cooperation between the two entities.","['https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8371885/', 'https://www.britannica.com/place/India/Constitutional-structure', 'https://academic.oup.com/publius/article-pdf/49/1/112/33043790/pjy022.pdf', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8371885/', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India', 'https://ecfr.eu/publication/a-sharp-right-turn-a-forecast-for-the-2024-european-parliament-elections/', 'https://academic.oup.com/publius/article-pdf/49/1/112/33043790/pjy022.pdf', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8250373/', 'https://carnegieendowment.org/2016/10/10/putting-periphery-at-center-indian-states-role-in-foreign-policy-pub-64724', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8371885/', 'https://www.britannica.com/place/India/Constitutional-structure', 'https://academic.oup.com/publius/article-pdf/49/1/112/33043790/pjy022.pdf']",politics

This is because the judiciary serves as a check on the executive and legislative branches, ensuring that they do not abuse their powers and that the Constitution is upheld. The implications of this for the overall functioning of the federal system in India are significant, as it ensures that the powers of the central government are balanced with those of the state governments, and that the rights of citizens are protected.","['https://www.state.gov/united-states-strategy-to-prevent-conflict-and-promote-stability/', 'https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/nsc/nssall.html', 'https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/19_0920_plcy_strategic-framework-countering-terrorism-targeted-violence.pdf', 'https://www.unodc.org/pdf/criminal_justice/Handbook_on_police_Accountability_Oversight_and_Integrity.pdf', 'https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/nsc/nssall.html', 'https://www.ncsl.org/about-state-legislatures/separation-of-powers-an-overview', 'https://www.uscourts.gov/about-federal-courts', 'https://academic.oup.com/icon/article/15/1/110/3068325', 'https://www.uscourts.gov/services-forms/federal-court-reporting-program']",politics

International Relations – Multilateralism
- The Hindu Article: http://goo.gl/9dov0F talks about failing multilateralism due to competition between regional powers and changing global order.
Multilateral – Regional – Intergovernmental – Bilateral – Unilateral
|Many countries from various regions working in concert on a specific issue or issues.
|Selected group of regional countries working in concert on a specific issue or issues.
|Selected group of like-minded countries working in concert on a specific issue or issues.
|Two counties working in concert on a common issue or issues.
|A single country trying to make one-sided decisions without consulting or involving the other stakeholders.
|All the respective players have a say. [Even small and weak players get to participate in decision making] [E.g. WTO Doha Round of Negotiations 2008 were a failure because of India]
|Regional groups constitute a unique set of players working towards a common cause.
Powerful countries steer the decision making process.
Weak countries simply fall in line or exit. [U.S.A steers the decision making in TPP. Vietnam simply falls in line]
|Intergovernmental groups constitute a unique set of players working towards a common cause. [They are mostly like-minded]
|Both the players have equal rights.
|One-sided action. Such action may be in disregard for other parties (stakeholders).
|Decisions are made mostly by majority vote.
|Decisions are made mostly by consensus.
|Decisions are made by consensus.
|Decisions are made by consensus.
|Decisions are one sided
|WTO, UN etc.
|TPP, RCEP, Bricks Bank, AIIB etc.
|Warsaw Pact, NATO etc.
|Indo-Pak, Indo-China etc.
China: South China Sea dispute [Neo-imperialism].
|E.g. WTO working towards a globalized world economy.
|E.g. TPP working towards a trade block involving Pacific Rim Countries.
|E.g. All NATO countries have a common security threat – Russia.
|E.g. Indo-Pak Ceasefire Agreement.
|E.g. 1) U.S.A waging oil wars in Middle East. 2) China building artificial islands in the disputed South China Sea region amidst opposition from the rest of the world.
|Multilateralism encourages members
to bury differences for greater good.
Power blocks strive for undue advantage.
|Everything depends on the objectives of the group.
|Positive outcome = good for both, negative outcome = bad for both.
|High levels of damage for the countries on the receiving end.
[E.g. 1) Pre-Independent India in the hands of UK. 2) Afghanistan, Iraq etc. in the hands of USA. 3) South East Asian countries in the hands of China]
Polarity: Bipolar world – Unipolar world – Multipolar world
- Depends on how many power centers or spheres of influence exit at a given point of time.
- Power center or sphere of influence: A powerful country rallies behind it a group of less powerful countries. All these countries come together based on a common ideology or/and common economic or/and strategic or/and political
|Distribution of power in which two states have the majority of economic, military, and cultural influence internationally or regionally.
|Distribution of power in which one state exercises most of the cultural, economic, and military influence.
|Distribution of power in which more than two nation-states have nearly equal amounts of military, cultural, and economic influence.
|The United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War era (1947-1990).
|The post-Cold War international system is unipolar with the United States being the sole power center of unmatched capabilities.
|Growth of China and India, weakening Russia and reduced American hegemony are all signs of the path to a new multipolar world. [Multipolarity is not yet achieved. The world at present is in a transition phase where power is shifting from west to east. (The balance of power is shifting from west to east)]
|Two distinct spheres of influence. [Western and capitalist states would fall under the influence of the USA. Communist states would fall under the influence of the USSR.]
|Only one distinct sphere of influence. Others are negligible or overshadowed by the most powerful one.
|More than two spheres of influence. [spheres of influence are not as rigid as in the case of unipolar and bipolar world]
Other strategic agreements
[Hegemonic stability theory]
- Hegemonic stability theory: Powerful states foster international orders that are stable. [No competition = no war]
- The Balance of power theory: as long as the international system remains in balance [(mostly multipolar world)(without unipolar power)], peace is maintained.
- Regionalism in International relations: The theory or practice of forming regional groups rather than going with a central system/systems of administration. [Pacific Rim countries initiated a regional trade group called as TPP – Trans-Pacific Partnership. TPP is seen as a regional rival/alternative to WTO (WTO has become too rigid with its trade negotiation rounds inconclusive and chaotic).]","How does the concept of ""soft power"" influence the decision-making process of a country in its efforts to achieve its foreign policy objectives, and what are the implications of this concept on the global stage?","The concept of soft power has significant implications on the global stage, as it allows countries to influence international relations and achieve their foreign policy objectives through non-coercive means. Soft power enables countries to shape the attitudes and behaviors of other nations, often through cultural, values-based, and institutional means. This can lead to increased international cooperation, improved global governance, and enhanced national reputation. However, the impact of soft power also depends on a country's ability to embody its values and principles on the world stage and at home.","['http://culturaldiplomacy.org/academy/content/pdf/participant-papers/2013-acdusa/What-Is-Soft-Power-Capability-And-How-Does-It-Impact-Foreign-Policy--Judit-Trunkos.pdf', 'https://education.cfr.org/learn/reading/what-soft-power', 'https://www.jstor.org/stable/1148580', 'http://culturaldiplomacy.org/academy/content/pdf/participant-papers/2013-acdusa/What-Is-Soft-Power-Capability-And-How-Does-It-Impact-Foreign-Policy--Judit-Trunkos.pdf', 'https://education.cfr.org/learn/reading/what-soft-power', 'https://www.jstor.org/stable/1148580', 'https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/JIPA/Display/Article/3212634/the-growth-of-south-korean-soft-power-and-its-geopolitical-implications/', 'https://www.jstor.org/stable/48615728', 'https://www.cfr.org/china-global-governance/', 'https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/JIPA/Display/Article/3212634/the-growth-of-south-korean-soft-power-and-its-geopolitical-implications/', 'https://brandfinance.com/insights/soft-power-why-it-matters', 'https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2020/12/the-case-for-south-korean-soft-power']",politics

3. Conflict resolution mechanisms: With the potential for conflicts arising from cultural, linguistic, and ideological differences, a system for resolving disputes and mediating conflicts could be essential.

4. Adaptability and flexibility: A government system that is able to adapt to changing circumstances, such as new discoveries or unexpected challenges, could be crucial for the success of the colony.

5. Transparency and accountability: A system that ensures transparency and accountability, such as regular reporting and auditing, could help to build trust and maintain public confidence in the government.

6. Education and training: A system that prioritizes education and training, particularly in areas such as science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), could help to ensure the colony's long-term success.

7. Resource management: A system that effectively manages resources, including food, water, energy, and waste, could be essential for the survival and prosperity of the colony.

8. International cooperation: A system that fosters international cooperation and collaboration, particularly with other space-faring nations, could help to ensure the colony's security and prosperity.

9. Crisis management: A system that is able to respond effectively to crises, such as natural disasters or unexpected challenges, could be crucial for the colony's survival.

"Concurrent List: There are 52 items on the Concurrent List (up from 47 previously). On this list, uniformity is desirable but not required.

The Union and the States each have their own executive staffs, which are supervised by their respective governments. Except when the presidential rule is imposed in a state, the union government cannot overrule the state government's constitutional rights and powers in legislative and administrative matters. The Union's responsibility is to ensure that each State's government operates in compliance with the Constitution's provisions, as outlined in Articles 355 and 256. In administrative concerns, state governments are not allowed to break federal legislation. When a state violates the Constitution, Presidential rule can be imposed under Article 356 and the President can take over the administration of the state with the Parliament's ex post facto assent under Article 357.
Federal Characteristics of Indian Constitution
The “Separation of Powers” idea is observed by these types of governments. India operates on the premise of a two-tiered government, with the central government and state governments sharing power. The Indian constitution, which envisions a parliamentary system of government, is federal in structure and unitary in nature. The three main branches of the federal government are the legislative, executive, and judicial.
The constitutional law comprises both legal in the strict sense and usages, generally referred to as conventions, which are acknowledged as binding by all those involved in government even if they are not enacted. Many regulations and practices aren't part of the law in the sense that breaking them can result in legal action.
The Indian Constitution is regarded to be a federal structure since it provides clear demarcation of boundaries between the central and state governments, similar to that of the United States. India's legislative and executive powers are shared between the centre and the states.
Let us describe the main features of Indian federal system.
Dual Polity: The Constitution creates a dual polity with the Union at the centre and the states at the periphery. Each is endowed with sovereign powers to be exercised in the different fields entrusted to them by the Constitution. The Union government is in charge of subjects of national importance such as defence, foreign affairs, currency, and communication, among others. State governments, on the other hand, are in charge of regional and local issues such as public order, agriculture, health, and local governance.
Written Constitution: The Constitution is not only a written document, but it is also the world's longest. It began with a Preamble, 395 Articles (split into 22 Parts), and 8 Schedules. At the time of writing (2013), it consists of a Preamble, approximately 465 Articles (split into 25 Parts), and 12 Schedules. It defines the structure, organization, powers, and functions of the federal and state governments, as well as the boundaries within which they must work. As a result, misunderstandings and arguments between the two are avoided.
Division of Powers: In the Seventh Schedule, the Constitution divided powers between the Centre and the states using the Union List, State List, and Concurrent List. The Union List is made up of 100 subjects (originally 97), the State List is made up of 61 subjects (originally 66), and the Concurrent List is made up of 52 subjects (originally 47). The Centre and the states can both pass legislation on the subjects on the concurrent list, but in the event of a conflict, the Central law takes precedence. The Centre receives residuary topics (those that are not specified in any of the three lists).
Constitutional Supremacy: The Constitution is the highest (or supreme) law of the land. The laws passed by the Centre and the states must be consistent with its provisions.

Federal Characteristics of Indian Constitution
The “Separation of Powers” idea is observed by these types of governments. India operates on the premise of a two-tiered government, with the central government and state governments sharing power. The Indian constitution, which envisions a parliamentary system of government, is federal in structure and unitary in nature. The three main branches of the federal government are the legislative, executive, and judicial.
The constitutional law comprises both legal in the strict sense and usages, generally referred to as conventions, which are acknowledged as binding by all those involved in government even if they are not enacted. Many regulations and practices aren't part of the law in the sense that breaking them can result in legal action.
The Indian Constitution is regarded to be a federal structure since it provides clear demarcation of boundaries between the central and state governments, similar to that of the United States. India's legislative and executive powers are shared between the centre and the states.
Let us describe the main features of Indian federal system.
Dual Polity: The Constitution creates a dual polity with the Union at the centre and the states at the periphery. Each is endowed with sovereign powers to be exercised in the different fields entrusted to them by the Constitution. The Union government is in charge of subjects of national importance such as defence, foreign affairs, currency, and communication, among others. State governments, on the other hand, are in charge of regional and local issues such as public order, agriculture, health, and local governance.
Written Constitution: The Constitution is not only a written document, but it is also the world's longest. It began with a Preamble, 395 Articles (split into 22 Parts), and 8 Schedules. At the time of writing (2013), it consists of a Preamble, approximately 465 Articles (split into 25 Parts), and 12 Schedules. It defines the structure, organization, powers, and functions of the federal and state governments, as well as the boundaries within which they must work. As a result, misunderstandings and arguments between the two are avoided.
Division of Powers: In the Seventh Schedule, the Constitution divided powers between the Centre and the states using the Union List, State List, and Concurrent List. The Union List is made up of 100 subjects (originally 97), the State List is made up of 61 subjects (originally 66), and the Concurrent List is made up of 52 subjects (originally 47). The Centre and the states can both pass legislation on the subjects on the concurrent list, but in the event of a conflict, the Central law takes precedence. The Centre receives residuary topics (those that are not specified in any of the three lists).
Constitutional Supremacy: The Constitution is the highest (or supreme) law of the land. The laws passed by the Centre and the states must be consistent with its provisions. Otherwise, they can be ruled null and void by the Supreme Court or the High Court using their judicial review powers. As a result, the institutions of government (legislative, executive, and judiciary) at both levels must work within the boundaries established by the Constitution.","Can the President of India impose President's Rule on a state without the approval of the Union Cabinet, citing a grave crisis in the state's administration, and what would be the implications of such a decision on the federal structure of the country?",The President of India cannot impose President's Rule on a state without the approval of the Union Cabinet.,"['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President%27s_rule', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/10/30/fact-sheet-president-biden-issues-executive-order-on-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-artificial-intelligence/', 'https://pib.gov.in/Pressreleaseshare.aspx?PRID=1592557', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President%27s_rule', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/10/30/fact-sheet-president-biden-issues-executive-order-on-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-artificial-intelligence/', 'https://pib.gov.in/Pressreleaseshare.aspx?PRID=1592557', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President%27s_rule', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/10/30/fact-sheet-president-biden-issues-executive-order-on-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-artificial-intelligence/', 'https://pib.gov.in/Pressreleaseshare.aspx?PRID=1592557']",politics

"With the current state of COVID-19, primary elections have been delayed, postponed, altered, and adjusted. No one knows for sure what will happen with even the presidential election, set in November of this year. Compared to the 2016 presidential election between Hilary Clinton and Donald Trump, the media seemed to exclusively focus on politics, but this year’s election coverage seems to be quite low. In this current time of relatively lessened political activity, perhaps now is the time to take a short break and look back at how politics first originated.
The basic foundations of Western politics were first developed by the Socratic political philosophers in Greece and further sharpened by the Ancient Romans. Although the political history of Greece and Rome ended long ago, the effects it has on modern culture are colossal as the theologies that were introduced still affect societies today.
During the ancient Greek times, four main political ideologies: democracy, monarchy, oligarchy, and tyranny were either developed or refined. The principles of democracy originated and developed in the city of Athens. Any male citizen who was at least 18 years old and had the ability to speak had the right to vote in governmental issues. Democracy at this level was unprecedented. The idea of monarchy and tyranny had existed before the Ancient Greek times but was further defined by the Greeks. The main difference between monarchs and tyrants was that monarchs were dictators who worked for the good of people while tyrants were dictators who worked for their own benefit. Oligarchy also developed during this time and is very close to representative democracy as it is when a small group of people run a state. Overall, within the political history of Greece, very different and distinct political systems coexisted and advanced together.
The next significant development in the history of politics occurred in the Ancient Roman Civilization. Unlike the political history of Greece, the political history of Rome is more of a timeline of stories rather than a comparison of different political ideals that were developed. Rome went through two major political changes before its fall. Rome was first established as the Roman kingdom, in which a monarch ruled. They soon developed into the Roman republic, in which the Senate held onto the central political authority. Finally, the republic evolved into the Roman Empire, in which an emperor ruled.
The Roman Kingdom is the earliest period of Ancient Rome. The monarchy settled in following the establishment of Ancient Rome. During this time, the monarchy had all central authority and power was in the hands of the king. The Senate had already been formed under the first king, Romulus, but it was more like an advisory group of nobles for the King. Eventually though, the Roman Kingdom would come to a stop as the seventh king of Rome, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, got involved in a series of scandals including use of violence and intimidation to showcase power, disrespecting the Senate, and having his son get into a serious scandal with a noble’s daughter. The King of Rome was overthrown and the monarchy was replaced with a republic.
During the time of the Roman Republic, politics greatly developed. The Senate evolved from being an advisory council to becoming the ultimate authority in Rome. The common people of Rome would elect two consuls (the senate’s leading chair) and the consuls would then appoint the senators. These senators would then run all the governmental work and vote to pass legislation and treaties. The Roman Republic has a lasting effect on the world. For example, foundations of American politics were borrowed from the Roman political system. Eventually though, Augustus, a Roman statesman and general, would take control of the Republic in 27 BC and the Roman Republic was replaced by the Roman Empire.
During the time of the Roman Empire, the power was in the hands of the emperor of Rome. Despite being mostly an authoritarian dictatorship on the inside, the imperial rulers tried to display the government as constitutional, distorting the senate to benefit the emperor. For example, the Praetorian Guard was formed, and this gave military power to Roman emperors as troops weren’t previously allowed in the capital city. Overall, during the time of the Roman Empire, the central emperor would hold all the governmental power and the common people had much less power.","** Question: What historical factor contributed to the rise of a distinct Athenian identity, influencing the development of democracy and citizenship in the city-state, and how did this factor impact the city's governance and cultural development in the 5th century BCE?","The historical factor that contributed to the rise of a distinct Athenian identity in the 5th century BCE was the concept of autochthony, which emphasized the idea that the Athenians were born from the earth itself, making them uniquely connected to the land and their city. This concept was emphasized through the writing of Thucydides and the study of fourth-century oratory, and it played a significant role in shaping Athenian identity and governance in the 5th century BCE.","['https://www.nysed.gov/sites/default/files/programs/curriculum-instruction/ss-framework-k-8a2.pdf', 'https://www.britannica.com/place/ancient-Greece', 'https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/404/', 'https://www.britannica.com/place/ancient-Greece', 'https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/realism-intl-relations/', 'https://classics.barnard.edu/race-and-ethnicity-ancient-mediterranean-world-methods-sources-and-assessments', 'https://www.britannica.com/place/ancient-Greece', 'https://digitalcommons.kennesaw.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1323&context=undergradsymposiumksu', 'https://classics-at.chs.harvard.edu/3-my-fair-lady-exploring-social-change-through-athenian-vase-painting-in-the-fifth-century-bce/']",politics

The next significant development in the history of politics occurred in the Ancient Roman Civilization. Unlike the political history of Greece, the political history of Rome is more of a timeline of stories rather than a comparison of different political ideals that were developed. Rome went through two major political changes before its fall. Rome was first established as the Roman kingdom, in which a monarch ruled. They soon developed into the Roman republic, in which the Senate held onto the central political authority. Finally, the republic evolved into the Roman Empire, in which an emperor ruled.
The Roman Kingdom is the earliest period of Ancient Rome. The monarchy settled in following the establishment of Ancient Rome. During this time, the monarchy had all central authority and power was in the hands of the king. The Senate had already been formed under the first king, Romulus, but it was more like an advisory group of nobles for the King. Eventually though, the Roman Kingdom would come to a stop as the seventh king of Rome, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, got involved in a series of scandals including use of violence and intimidation to showcase power, disrespecting the Senate, and having his son get into a serious scandal with a noble’s daughter. The King of Rome was overthrown and the monarchy was replaced with a republic.
During the time of the Roman Republic, politics greatly developed. The Senate evolved from being an advisory council to becoming the ultimate authority in Rome. The common people of Rome would elect two consuls (the senate’s leading chair) and the consuls would then appoint the senators. These senators would then run all the governmental work and vote to pass legislation and treaties. The Roman Republic has a lasting effect on the world. For example, foundations of American politics were borrowed from the Roman political system. Eventually though, Augustus, a Roman statesman and general, would take control of the Republic in 27 BC and the Roman Republic was replaced by the Roman Empire.
During the time of the Roman Empire, the power was in the hands of the emperor of Rome. Despite being mostly an authoritarian dictatorship on the inside, the imperial rulers tried to display the government as constitutional, distorting the senate to benefit the emperor. For example, the Praetorian Guard was formed, and this gave military power to Roman emperors as troops weren’t previously allowed in the capital city. Overall, during the time of the Roman Empire, the central emperor would hold all the governmental power and the common people had much less power.","How did the lack of a formal constitution in Ancient Greece contribute to the development of the concept of natural law, which would later influence the way Roman statesmen like Cicero approached governance?","The lack of a formal constitution in Ancient Greece likely contributed to the development of the concept of natural law, which was already present in ancient Greek philosophy, including Aristotle.

"If politicians genuinely respected “the people’s will”, they would let us express it between elections.
By George Monbiot, published in the Guardian 24th October 2019
They promised sovereignty, but at first it was unclear which variety of sovereignty they meant. Were the politicians who swore we would regain it when we left the European Union referring to parliamentary sovereignty or popular sovereignty? Now we know they didn’t mean parliamentary sovereignty. Boris Johnson’s government has sought to trick, rush, ignore and prorogue Parliament at every turn.
“People v Parliament” is his pitch to the nation. So where do the people come in? If Johnson is a champion of popular sovereignty, why does he propose no improvements to a 19th Century model of democracy, that permits no popular engagement other than an election every few years, and a referendum every few decades?
There is a tension between parliamentary and popular sovereignty. A lively, meaningful democracy would achieve a balance between the two. It would combine parliamentary (representative) democracy with participatory democracy. But no such balance is sought.
Representative democracy is a remarkably blunt instrument. Hundreds of issues are bundled together at every election, yet the vote tends to swing on just one or two of them. The government then presumes consent for its entire programme, and, if it commands a parliamentary majority, for anything else it wants to introduce in its term of office. We don’t accept presumed consent in sex. Why should we accept it in politics?
I’ve often been asked, when I complain about a government policy, “so why don’t you stand for election?”. This suggests that the only valid political role a citizen can play is to become a representative, meaning that only a tiny proportion of the population has a legitimate voice between elections. This is the shallowest and weakest of the possible conceptions of democracy.
I don’t want to abandon representative democracy. I want to see it balanced by popular sovereignty, especially the variety known as deliberative democracy. By contrast to the adversarial nature of representative democracy, in which politicians try to dominate and vanquish their opponents, deliberative democracy means drawing citizens together to solve problems. It means creating forums in which we listen respectfully to each other, seek to understand each other’s views, change our minds when necessary, and create the rich, informed democratic culture currently missing from national life.
Perhaps the best example is the participatory budgeting programme in the Brazilian city of Porto Alegre, particularly during its most effective phase, between 1989 and 2004. During these years, citizens were able to decide how the city’s entire investment budget should be spent. The process was designed by government and people working together, and was allowed to evolve as citizens suggested improvements. The budget discussions were open to everyone, and some 50,000 people a year participated.
Instead of being captured by corrupt politicians and local mafias, the people’s decisions ensured that the money went to where it was needed most, greatly improving sanitation, clean water, green space, health and education, transforming the lives of the poor. Porto Alegre became the Brazilian state capital with the highest ranking on the human development index. The more people engaged, the wider and deeper their political understanding became. Short-termism was replaced by long-term thinking: essential if we are to confront environmental breakdown.
There are plenty of other ways in which deliberative democracy can change our lives. In Ireland, a citizens’ assembly on abortion law turned an angry debate into a considered one, tested competing claims and ideas, and led eventually to a referendum. The Better Reykjavík programme allows the citizens of Iceland’s capital to put forward ideas for the city’s improvement, that other people vote on. The fifteen most popular ideas every month are passed to the city council to consider. The programme has remodelled the city in fascinating ways.
Constitutional conventions can be used to draw up principles of government, on which the rest of the population can then vote. The best models are perhaps those developed by the Canadian provinces of British Columbia and Ontario. Members of the convention are drawn by lot, and informed by experts, field trips and submissions from other citizens. The UK seems to be in urgent need of one.","How might the use of social media by politicians during an election campaign influence the way citizens form their opinions on issues related to environmental breakdown, and what implications might this have for the effectiveness of deliberative democracy in addressing this issue?","The use of social media by politicians during an election campaign can significantly influence the way citizens form their opinions on issues related to environmental breakdown, as it can shape public discourse and create a sense of urgency or complacency around the issue.

"If politicians genuinely respected “the people’s will”, they would let us express it between elections.
By George Monbiot, published in the Guardian 24th October 2019
They promised sovereignty, but at first it was unclear which variety of sovereignty they meant. Were the politicians who swore we would regain it when we left the European Union referring to parliamentary sovereignty or popular sovereignty? Now we know they didn’t mean parliamentary sovereignty. Boris Johnson’s government has sought to trick, rush, ignore and prorogue Parliament at every turn.
“People v Parliament” is his pitch to the nation. So where do the people come in? If Johnson is a champion of popular sovereignty, why does he propose no improvements to a 19th Century model of democracy, that permits no popular engagement other than an election every few years, and a referendum every few decades?
There is a tension between parliamentary and popular sovereignty. A lively, meaningful democracy would achieve a balance between the two. It would combine parliamentary (representative) democracy with participatory democracy. But no such balance is sought.
Representative democracy is a remarkably blunt instrument. Hundreds of issues are bundled together at every election, yet the vote tends to swing on just one or two of them. The government then presumes consent for its entire programme, and, if it commands a parliamentary majority, for anything else it wants to introduce in its term of office. We don’t accept presumed consent in sex. Why should we accept it in politics?
I’ve often been asked, when I complain about a government policy, “so why don’t you stand for election?”. This suggests that the only valid political role a citizen can play is to become a representative, meaning that only a tiny proportion of the population has a legitimate voice between elections. This is the shallowest and weakest of the possible conceptions of democracy.
I don’t want to abandon representative democracy. I want to see it balanced by popular sovereignty, especially the variety known as deliberative democracy. By contrast to the adversarial nature of representative democracy, in which politicians try to dominate and vanquish their opponents, deliberative democracy means drawing citizens together to solve problems. It means creating forums in which we listen respectfully to each other, seek to understand each other’s views, change our minds when necessary, and create the rich, informed democratic culture currently missing from national life.
Perhaps the best example is the participatory budgeting programme in the Brazilian city of Porto Alegre, particularly during its most effective phase, between 1989 and 2004. During these years, citizens were able to decide how the city’s entire investment budget should be spent. The process was designed by government and people working together, and was allowed to evolve as citizens suggested improvements. The budget discussions were open to everyone, and some 50,000 people a year participated.

"- Many different factors can be influential on the choice of the people in free and fair elections which are the requirements of democracy. Economic, political, social, and other reasons determine people’s political choice and political power. However, how this people’s will can be reflected, how the votes will be counted, how it will be represented and how many seats it will correspond to are actually determined according to the election laws. Also, electoral laws, like all laws, are actually the product of the legislature’s political choice. Moreover, since the election laws have a special and direct effect and importance on the determination of the next election result and the next political power, they are the laws that it especially is wanted to shape by the current political power in order to ensure their continuity. However, like many other laws, it is important for legal security that they preserve certain basic principles, conform to the constitution of the country, and have little variability. Moreover, the frequent changes in election laws depending on the political power is a threat to democracy. In other words, stable electoral laws in accordance with the constitution and the requirements of democracy are the requirement of free and fair election and the legal and formal condition of the fair reflection of the will of the voters.
- Electoral laws are basically based on the political choice of the legislator over how to resolve the conflict of interest between the fair representation of the votes, and the creation of strong and thus stable governments. Italy also for the same purposes, from the beginning of the reform process until today, four law changes have been made under different names. These changes; Mattarellum made in 1993, Porcellum made in 2005, Italicum made in 2014, and Rosatellum made in 2017.
- During the process that started with the arrest of Mario Chiesa from the Italian Socialist Party (PSI) on February 17, 1992, on the grounds that he was bribed, a serious network of corruption emerged within the political parties. In the continuation of the process, the decrease in trust in political parties and the economic problems experienced by political parties led to the shrinkage of political parties and this situation caused the 1993 Election Reform (MATTARELLUM) to come into effect. The most important aspect of this change is that the proportional representation system, which has been applied since 1948, was terminated and the transition to the mixed system. Proportional representation electoral systems, on the other hand, are the common name of systems that require political parties to be represented in proportion to their votes. For this reason, it can be said that as a result of this election law, a majoritarian understanding has been adopted. This understanding resulted in the bipolar formation of political life and an increase in pre-election alliances.
- The 2005 election reform (PORCELLUM) is the Berlusconi government’s amendment to the electoral law for purely political motives. This change has many unusual and troublesome features. Firstly, the electoral law change was made just before the election. Secondly, the method of voting candidates for parties by lists has been adopted, but some electoral districts are still allowed to nominate individual candidates. One of the most interesting aspects of the change is that it allows a candidate to be included in the list of more than one constituency. For example, Berlusconi ran as the top of the list in all electoral districts. In addition, a premium system that can transform the simple majority into absolute majority has been adopted. In order to ensure stability in the administration, according to this regulation, the number of seats of the party or alliance that received the highest number of votes at the “national level” in the parliamentary elections is increased to 340. However, this regulation seriously harms the principle of fairness in representation. This situation was clearly observed especially in the 2013 elections. “According to the 2013 election results, each of the alliances (the left alliance led by the Democratic Party and the right alliance led by Forza Italy) and the Five Star Movement received over 25% of the vote. Even though it won the election by a very small margin, it also won the majority with the most votes. As a matter of fact, although the left alliance had 29% of the votes, it was entitled to the majority because it received the highest vote among those participating in the election. Thus, the representation rate in the Assembly of Deputies suddenly reached 54% due to the majority premium. ” (Altınsu & Arıkan)","How does the rise of digital media influence the ability of political parties to connect with voters and build grassroots support, and what are the implications for political representation in a mixed system?","The rise of digital media has both positive and negative implications for political parties' ability to connect with voters and build grassroots support, and its impact on political representation in a mixed system is complex and multifaceted.","['https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2022/12/06/social-media-seen-as-mostly-good-for-democracy-across-many-nations-but-u-s-is-a-major-outlier/', 'https://www.bbvaopenmind.com/en/articles/the-new-media-s-role-in-politics/', 'https://www.americanbar.org/groups/crsj/publications/human_rights_magazine_home/voting-in-2020/political-advertising-on-social-media-platforms/', 'https://academic.oup.com/poq/article/84/S1/355/5855290', 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15377857.2011.540224', 'https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0093650211426004', 'https://www.accc.gov.au/system/files/ACCC+commissioned+report+-+The+impact+of+digital+platforms+on+news+and+journalistic+content,+Centre+for+Media+Transition+(2).pdf', 'https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1940161216645335?icid=int.sj-abstract.citing-articles.203', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7343248/']",politics

Moreover, the frequent changes in election laws depending on the political power is a threat to democracy. In other words, stable electoral laws in accordance with the constitution and the requirements of democracy are the requirement of free and fair election and the legal and formal condition of the fair reflection of the will of the voters.
- Electoral laws are basically based on the political choice of the legislator over how to resolve the conflict of interest between the fair representation of the votes, and the creation of strong and thus stable governments. Italy also for the same purposes, from the beginning of the reform process until today, four law changes have been made under different names. These changes; Mattarellum made in 1993, Porcellum made in 2005, Italicum made in 2014, and Rosatellum made in 2017.
- During the process that started with the arrest of Mario Chiesa from the Italian Socialist Party (PSI) on February 17, 1992, on the grounds that he was bribed, a serious network of corruption emerged within the political parties. In the continuation of the process, the decrease in trust in political parties and the economic problems experienced by political parties led to the shrinkage of political parties and this situation caused the 1993 Election Reform (MATTARELLUM) to come into effect. The most important aspect of this change is that the proportional representation system, which has been applied since 1948, was terminated and the transition to the mixed system. Proportional representation electoral systems, on the other hand, are the common name of systems that require political parties to be represented in proportion to their votes. For this reason, it can be said that as a result of this election law, a majoritarian understanding has been adopted. This understanding resulted in the bipolar formation of political life and an increase in pre-election alliances.
- The 2005 election reform (PORCELLUM) is the Berlusconi government’s amendment to the electoral law for purely political motives. This change has many unusual and troublesome features. Firstly, the electoral law change was made just before the election. Secondly, the method of voting candidates for parties by lists has been adopted, but some electoral districts are still allowed to nominate individual candidates. One of the most interesting aspects of the change is that it allows a candidate to be included in the list of more than one constituency. For example, Berlusconi ran as the top of the list in all electoral districts. In addition, a premium system that can transform the simple majority into absolute majority has been adopted. In order to ensure stability in the administration, according to this regulation, the number of seats of the party or alliance that received the highest number of votes at the “national level” in the parliamentary elections is increased to 340. However, this regulation seriously harms the principle of fairness in representation. This situation was clearly observed especially in the 2013 elections. “According to the 2013 election results, each of the alliances (the left alliance led by the Democratic Party and the right alliance led by Forza Italy) and the Five Star Movement received over 25% of the vote. Even though it won the election by a very small margin, it also won the majority with the most votes. As a matter of fact, although the left alliance had 29% of the votes, it was entitled to the majority because it received the highest vote among those participating in the election. Thus, the representation rate in the Assembly of Deputies suddenly reached 54% due to the majority premium. ” (Altınsu & Arıkan)","How would you compare the impact of a political leader's personal interests on electoral laws in a country with a strong tradition of political corruption, such as Italy, versus a country with a strong tradition of political integrity, such as Finland?","The impact of a political leader's personal interests on electoral laws in a country with a strong tradition of political corruption, such as Italy, versus a country with a strong tradition of political integrity, such as Finland, is significant.

"- Many different factors can be influential on the choice of the people in free and fair elections which are the requirements of democracy. Economic, political, social, and other reasons determine people’s political choice and political power. However, how this people’s will can be reflected, how the votes will be counted, how it will be represented and how many seats it will correspond to are actually determined according to the election laws. Also, electoral laws, like all laws, are actually the product of the legislature’s political choice.

"Rigid Constitution: The separation of powers created by the Constitution, as well as the Constitution's supremacy, can only be preserved if the system of modification is rigid. As a result, the Constitution is inflexible to the point that those parts dealing with the federal structure (i.e., Center–state relations and judicial organization) can only be modified by a joint decision of the Central and state governments. Such regulations necessitate a special majority in Parliament as well as the consent of half of the state legislatures in order to be amended.
Independent Judiciary: The Constitution established an independent judiciary led by the Supreme Court for two purposes: one, to safeguard the supremacy of the Constitution through the exercise of judicial review; and two, to settle disputes between the Centre and the states or between the states. To make the judiciary independent of the government, the Constitution includes provisions such as tenure security for judges, defined service conditions, and so on.
Bicameralism: The Constitution establishes a bicameral legislature with an Upper House (Rajya Sabha) and a Lower House (Lok Sabha). The Rajya Sabha represents the states of the Indian Federation, whereas the Lok Sabha represents the entire population of India.

There is one more important feature of Federalism besides the above written points and that is called ""Dual Citizenship"".

Federalism is a principle that describes a government structure in which authority is divided between the national and state governments. It is a two-machine system that governs a country.

In a federal system, power is distributed among different branches and levels of government, ensuring that no one branch or level has absolute authority. This distribution of power provides checks and balances, preventing any one entity from abusing its power and ensuring that the government remains accountable to the people. In contrast, a unitary system has a centralized government with a single authority, which can lead to a concentration of power and potential abuse. The implications of checks and balances in a federal system are that it promotes accountability, prevents abuse of power, and ensures that the government remains responsive to the needs and rights of citizens.","['https://wwnorton.com/college/polisci/american-government12/brief/ch/03/outline.aspx', 'https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/House_of_Representatives/Powers_practice_and_procedure/00_-_Infosheets/Infosheet_20_-_The_Australian_system_of_government', 'https://www.bundesrat.de/EN/funktionen-en/funktion-en/funktion-en-node.html', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/our-government/the-constitution/', 'https://constitution-unit.com/2023/01/19/checks-and-balances-what-are-they-and-why-do-they-matter/', 'https://guides.loc.gov/federalist-papers/text-51-60', 'https://wwnorton.com/college/polisci/american-government12/brief/ch/03/outline.aspx', 'https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/House_of_Representatives/Powers_practice_and_procedure/00_-_Infosheets/Infosheet_20_-_The_Australian_system_of_government', 'https://www.bundesrat.de/EN/funktionen-en/funktion-en/funktion-en-node.html']",politics
"Rigid Constitution: The separation of powers created by the Constitution, as well as the Constitution's supremacy, can only be preserved if the system of modification is rigid.

Such regulations necessitate a special majority in Parliament as well as the consent of half of the state legislatures in order to be amended.
Independent Judiciary: The Constitution established an independent judiciary led by the Supreme Court for two purposes: one, to safeguard the supremacy of the Constitution through the exercise of judicial review; and two, to settle disputes between the Centre and the states or between the states. To make the judiciary independent of the government, the Constitution includes provisions such as tenure security for judges, defined service conditions, and so on.

6. Conflict Management
This “higher order” interpersonal skill helps colleagues avoid or resolve conflicts. When the members of an organization are in conflict with each other, the leaders are generally called upon to adjudicate. However, the ability to either avoid or resolve conflict situations is also involved in this.
How to Develop Conflict Management Skills?
Courses and workshops are available to assist you in understanding and learning conflict management strategies. A vital aspect of conflict management with respect to leadership competencies is to help the parties involved in the conflict to compromise (wherein each party should have the flexibility of giving up something) or collaborate (a win-win outcome).
7. Decision Making
The core leadership competencies are making good decisions or leading a good decision-making process. The ways of making decisions can be better or worse. Still, a good leader knows when to decide, when the peers and subordinates must be consulted and brought into the decision-making process, and when the time is right to take a step back and allow others to make decisions.
How to develop decision-making skills?
The best way of honing decision-making skills is by experiencing and studying situations where decisions have gone wrong. People learn more often from the mistakes that they have committed rather than from the success that they have achieved.
8. Political Skills
It is a fact that all organizations or groups at their core are full of workplace politics. To move ahead, people attempt to gain allies, break the rules and push forward their agendas. An effective leader is also a good player politically, has knowledge regarding the rules that need to be followed for playing the game, and can manage political behavior to prevent it from resulting in the dysfunction of the group or the organization.
How to Develop Political Competencies?
In the same way, as with several of the other leadership competencies that are highly developed, political skills are acquired through learning from experience, social dynamics, and people.
9. Influence Skills
Leadership, at its core, is all about influencing other people’s behavior. Therefore, a great leader is someone who is a master of social influence and can wield power fairly and effectively. You can become all the more influential in the leadership role if you can develop interpersonal or soft skills.

10. Area Competence / Expertise
In today’s age, the significance of knowledge in every aspect of jobs is less important than it was. In creative firms or high-tech industries, the team members might possess more relevant knowledge and expertise than the leaders. Still, leaders must develop expertise in particular situations, industries, or organizations where they are in leadership roles.

Apart from the above-mentioned competencies, leaders should also possess the competencies of agility, speed, passion, and focus to succeed. Such skills, however, cannot be taught.

"Fortitude or courage is another cardinal virtue. This includes the courage to take calculated risks, stand up for your beliefs, and do the right things.
How to develop courage?
Its roots lie in the development and the holding of strong personal values. If you value someone or something sincerely, you will possess the courage to stand up for your principles and your people.
6. Conflict Management
This “higher order” interpersonal skill helps colleagues avoid or resolve conflicts. When the members of an organization are in conflict with each other, the leaders are generally called upon to adjudicate. However, the ability to either avoid or resolve conflict situations is also involved in this.
How to Develop Conflict Management Skills?
Courses and workshops are available to assist you in understanding and learning conflict management strategies. A vital aspect of conflict management with respect to leadership competencies is to help the parties involved in the conflict to compromise (wherein each party should have the flexibility of giving up something) or collaborate (a win-win outcome).
7. Decision Making
The core leadership competencies are making good decisions or leading a good decision-making process. The ways of making decisions can be better or worse. Still, a good leader knows when to decide, when the peers and subordinates must be consulted and brought into the decision-making process, and when the time is right to take a step back and allow others to make decisions.
How to develop decision-making skills?
The best way of honing decision-making skills is by experiencing and studying situations where decisions have gone wrong. People learn more often from the mistakes that they have committed rather than from the success that they have achieved.
8. Political Skills
It is a fact that all organizations or groups at their core are full of workplace politics. To move ahead, people attempt to gain allies, break the rules and push forward their agendas. An effective leader is also a good player politically, has knowledge regarding the rules that need to be followed for playing the game, and can manage political behavior to prevent it from resulting in the dysfunction of the group or the organization.
How to Develop Political Competencies?
In the same way, as with several of the other leadership competencies that are highly developed, political skills are acquired through learning from experience, social dynamics, and people.
9. Influence Skills
Leadership, at its core, is all about influencing other people’s behavior. Therefore, a great leader is someone who is a master of social influence and can wield power fairly and effectively. You can become all the more influential in the leadership role if you can develop interpersonal or soft skills.
How to develop Influence Skills?
Reasoned and well-thought-out arguments are useful after getting trained in debating. Viewing things from the perspective of the other person may assist you in understanding what the things expected by them from negotiation are. This will let you focus on a situation that is a win-win.
10. Area Competence / Expertise
In today’s age, the significance of knowledge in every aspect of jobs is less important than it was. In creative firms or high-tech industries, the team members might possess more relevant knowledge and expertise than the leaders. Still, leaders must develop expertise in particular situations, industries, or organizations where they are in leadership roles.
How to develop Area Competencies?
Development is a lifelong process, similar to all the other competencies. You need to study the organization and also study the competitors of the organization. Effective leaders gain competence and expertise and attempt to gain as much knowledge as possible regarding their organization, product, and team members.
Apart from the above-mentioned competencies, leaders should also possess the competencies of agility, speed, passion, and focus to succeed. Such skills, however, cannot be taught. If an organization requires and supports these leadership competencies as a basis of its success, they must be instilled through an embedded system of leadership development. The success of such a program is dependent on five crucial factors, which include the –
- Support provided by the Executive Leadership
- Challenging work assignments
- The right people
- The supportive environment of work
- Instead of a course for skills, there should be a Leadership Development System.","Can you describe a situation where a lack of effective communication led to a misunderstanding between two team members, and how the leader intervened to resolve the issue?","A situation where a lack of effective communication led to a misunderstanding between two team members is described in a study titled ""SBAR improves communication and safety climate and decreases incident reports due to communication errors in an anaesthetic clinic: A prospective intervention study"". The study reports on a team leader's intervention to resolve a misunderstanding between two team members in an anaesthetic clinic. The misunderstanding arose due to communication errors, which led to a near-miss incident.

"President Jackson argued in the early 19th century that any reasonably intelligent citizen could perform the duties of public office. During his time America was a pre-industrial society, therefore this notion might have been true. In the more complex age of the early twentieth century it became apparent that many functions of the government required expert specialists. This principle was echoed by progressive governor Robert Lafayette of Wisconsin (1901-1906). He established a collative Reference Bureau to provide research, advice, and help in drafting legislation.
This Bureau became known as the Wisconsin Idea of efficient government, and it became widely publicized and copied during the progressive era. Lafayette also pushed for conservation of natural resources, tighter OR regulation, and workmen’s compensation. Throughout the period many states, such as Georgia, California, and Alabama, elected progressive governors. Additionally, numerous congressional, state, and local progressive officials were elected into office. Regulation: The regulation of large corporations engaged a greater diversity f reformers and elicited far more controversial solutions than any other issue of the Progressive era.
The problem of economic power and abuse offered a dilemma for Progressives. Four broad solutions were available at the time: 1) Laissez-Fairer economics, or letting businesses control their own destinies without government regulations, 2) adopting a socialist program of public ownership, 3) adopt a policy of trust-busting in the belief that restoring old fashion competition would prevent economic abuse, or 4) accept big business but regulate it to prevent abuses. In the end the trend was toward exultation of big business, although this led to another problem: Regulatory agencies often came under control of those they were supposed to regulate.
OR leaders, for instance, generally had a more intimate knowledge of the intricacies of their business. Consequently, they had an advantage over the officials who might be appointed to the Interstate Commerce Commission. Social Justice: a fourth feature of progressivism was the impulse toward social justice, which covered everything from private charity to campaigns against child labor or liquor. The Industrial and urban revolution made many live that the social evils that resulted extended beyond the reach of private charities and demanded the power of the state.
Consent intently, the best way to achieve social justice was through legislation. The National Child Labor Committee, organized in 1904, led a movement for laws banning the still widespread employment of young children. Another group, the National Consumers League, led by the ardent socialist Florence Kelley, led a crusade for the passage of legislation that regulated the hours of work for women, especially wives and mothers. Many states also outlawed night work and abort in dangerous occupations for both women and children.
Legislation to protect workers from accidents gained momentum following the Triangle Fire (191 1), and stricter building codes and factory inspections soon followed the disaster. Finally, the opposition to alcohol was an ideal cause to merge the older private ethics with the new social ethics of the period. Given the moral disrepute of saloons, many prohibitionists equated the liquor traffic with the evils of machine politics, prostitution, and other urban problems. The prohibitionist movement dated as far back as 1874, with the Women’s Christian Temperance Union.
The most successful political action, however, came with the Anti-Saloon League, founded in 1893. This organization was one of the first single-issue lobbyist groups of the time. By singleness of purpose the group was able to force the liquor issue into the forefront of local and state elections. In 1913 the SSL held its Jubilee Convention, where it endorsed a prohibition amendment to the constitution. As we’ll see later, the prohibition amendment was ratified in 1919. Education, Consumerism, and Public Health: The progressive movement brought new ways of looking at the issues of the day.
Education: the changing patterns Of school attendance called for new attitudes toward education. In the late 19th century, when America was predominantly rural, most children worked on the family farm instead of attending school.

"The movement had many causes, most notably the Depression of the 1 sass and the Populist movement In fact, a Kansas editor referred to Progressivism as “populism that had shaved its whiskers, washed its shirt, put on a derby, and moved up into the middle class. ” The Progressive Era, the years 1895-1920, was an idealistic period, one that focused on constructive social, economic, and political change.
Progressives believed that the complex social ills and tensions generated by the urban- industrial revolution required expanding the scope of local, state, and federal government authority. This, they believed, would ensure the progress of American society. The progressive movement refers to the common spirit Of an age rather than to an organized group or party. Progressivism was so diverse in its origins and intentions that few people adhered to all of its principles.
Nevertheless, Progressivism became one of the central elements of American liberalism, and the legislation and initiatives of the period lay the first steps for what would become in the 1 9305 the Welfare state. Antecedents to Progressivism: 1) Populism: Populism was undoubtedly the impetus for the growth of Progressivism. The Omaha Platform of 1892 outlined many of the reforms that would later be accomplished during the Progressive Era. 2) Mumps: this group supplied Progressives with an important element of its thinking: the honest government.
The new problems that arose in urban areas, such as crime, and efficient provision of water, electricity, sewage, and garbage collection, led to a growing number of elected officials with this new outlook toward honesty and efficiency. 3) Socialism: the Socialist Party of the time served as the left wing of progressivism. The growing familiarity with socialist doctrine and its critique of urban living and working conditions became a significant force in fostering the spirit of progressivism.
Nevertheless, most progressives could not stomach the remedies offered by socialists, and the Progressive reform impulse grew in part from a desire to counter the growing influence of socialist doctrine. 4) Muckrakers: social critics, usually writers, who thrived on exposing scandal. These people got their name when Teddy Roosevelt imparted them to a character in a book called Pilgrim’s Progress: “a man that could look no way but downwards with a muckrake in his hands. ” Roosevelt believed that the muckrakers are often indispensable to society, but only if they knew when to stop raking the muck.
The chief outlets for these social critics were the inexpensive magazines that began to flourish in the asses, such as Arena and McClure. The golden age of muckraking is sometimes dated from 1 902 when McClure began to run articles by reporter Lincoln Stiffens on municipal corruption. The articles were later compiled into a kook, published in 1904, called The Shame of the Cities. Other works that began as magazine articles exposed corruption in the stock market, life insurance, the meat industry, and politics.
The Features of Progressivism: Democracy: the most important reform with which the Progressives tried to democratic government was the Direct Primary, or the nomination of candidates by the vote of party members. Under the existing convention system, only a small percentage of the voters attended the local caucuses or precinct meetings which sent delegates to county, state, and national elections. This allowed the rise of professional politicians who stayed in office for extremely long periods of time.
In 1896 South Carolina adopted the first statewide primary, and within two decades this system had been implemented by nearly all states for Senators and congressmen. Finally, the Seventeenth Amendment, ratified in 191 3, authorized the direct election of senators by popular vote. The primary system was but one expression of a broad movement for direct democracy. During the period many states passed the Initiative, Referendum, and Recall. The initiative, first passed in 898 in South Dakota, provided the opportunity for citizens to create legislation by getting a set number of signatures on a petition.
The electorate would then vote the issue up or down, this being the referendum. The recall provided the opportunity to remove officials by petition and vote.

"The workload of the Election Commission will be evenly distributed over a period of 5 years (60 months) instead of over 2/3 months. In this scenario, the requirement for EVMs and other peripheral equipment will be reduced by a factor of 25-30. No additional EVMs/ VVPAT machines will be required for the 2024 poll – the stock currently available is estimated to have cost INR 2,000 crore.
Indeed, a lot of what we have can be sold or even gifted to democracies in our neighbourhood as a gesture of goodwill. For the 2024 Simultaneous Poll, it has been estimated that we will need new units, costing an estimated INR 14,000 crore; with staggered elections, this will shrink to INR 500 crore.
There are several reforms that can be considered, as funds will now be available.
i) At present we have about 10,00,000 (ten lakh) polling stations – each one equipped to handle, in theory, about 800-1,000 voters. This is not enough, as the long queues currently seen at polling stations, comprising people waiting for an hour or more, testify. What we need is one polling station per 500 voters. A voter presenting herself at a polling station should be out in less than 5 minutes, having voted successfully. To do this, the cost of staggered elections will go up to INR 1,000 crore, which is still insignificant compared to the INR 14,000 crore that would have to be set aside for simultaneous (without the staggering of poll dates) elections.
ii) Another weakness of the ECI is that it is almost entirely dependent on the staff on loan from the local administration for conducting elections. And with the seasonal nature of its work, there is no alternative. But once the work is perennial, this need not be so. The ECI can have its own staff, highly trained and dedicated, and completely free from potentially parochial political influence. The need for borrowed staff, with limited powers, for the duration of election in a particular section, will be relatively minimal. This can be done by creating an Indian Election Service, answerable only to the President, through the Chief Election Commissioner. All responsibilities and accounting of the entire staffing operation can be and should be segregated and isolated from the usual executive line of command.
iii) The proposed funding of candidates, hanging fire for ages due to lack of funds, can be implemented now. Only the modalities to ensure its just and fair distribution needs to be agreed upon. The present system, that allows political parties to muster up concealed resources for candidates, can be eliminated. The recent introduction of anonymised funding through electoral bonds has hugely distorted electoral politics and tips the odds massively against independent representatives. This scheme can be shut down once candidate funding is set up.

The Nemesis of History
The experience of the Emergency, declared in 1975, should be a lesson when amending the Constitution to modify national institutions. Luckily, there was almost no violence at the time, the armed forces remained distant from civilian matters, and normalcy was soon restored. But it must be ensured that such a thing never happens again.
With Simultaneous Staggered Elections, the legacy of dissolution of the Parliament, and the possibility of mid-term elections will be put to rest. The Parliament will become a continuing entity, with members retiring after their five year term, substituted by newly elected members. This is a major change in the manner of conduct of a parliamentary democracy, with enormous potential to eliminate significant ills of incumbency and accumulation of power. It restores the ability to effectively build the Parliament itself into a functioning electoral college, which could make the government in power far more accountable, as its continuance will be dependent on its ability to win votes on Bills proposed by the ruling party. In turn, this raises the possibility that Bills proposed by non-ruling parties or independents are treated on their merits, professionalising the functioning of the Houses of Parliament and minimising the ills of partisan politics interfering with governance.","Can the Election Commission effectively handle the increased workload from implementing simultaneous staggered elections while maintaining the integrity of the electoral process?

"The workload of the Election Commission will be evenly distributed over a period of 5 years (60 months) instead of over 2/3 months. In this scenario, the requirement for EVMs and other peripheral equipment will be reduced by a factor of 25-30. No additional EVMs/ VVPAT machines will be required for the 2024 poll – the stock currently available is estimated to have cost INR 2,000 crore.
Indeed, a lot of what we have can be sold or even gifted to democracies in our neighbourhood as a gesture of goodwill. For the 2024 Simultaneous Poll, it has been estimated that we will need new units, costing an estimated INR 14,000 crore; with staggered elections, this will shrink to INR 500 crore.
There are several reforms that can be considered, as funds will now be available.
i) At present we have about 10,00,000 (ten lakh) polling stations – each one equipped to handle, in theory, about 800-1,000 voters. This is not enough, as the long queues currently seen at polling stations, comprising people waiting for an hour or more, testify. What we need is one polling station per 500 voters. A voter presenting herself at a polling station should be out in less than 5 minutes, having voted successfully. To do this, the cost of staggered elections will go up to INR 1,000 crore, which is still insignificant compared to the INR 14,000 crore that would have to be set aside for simultaneous (without the staggering of poll dates) elections.
ii) Another weakness of the ECI is that it is almost entirely dependent on the staff on loan from the local administration for conducting elections. And with the seasonal nature of its work, there is no alternative. But once the work is perennial, this need not be so. The ECI can have its own staff, highly trained and dedicated, and completely free from potentially parochial political influence. The need for borrowed staff, with limited powers, for the duration of election in a particular section, will be relatively minimal. This can be done by creating an Indian Election Service, answerable only to the President, through the Chief Election Commissioner. All responsibilities and accounting of the entire staffing operation can be and should be segregated and isolated from the usual executive line of command.
iii) The proposed funding of candidates, hanging fire for ages due to lack of funds, can be implemented now. Only the modalities to ensure its just and fair distribution needs to be agreed upon. The present system, that allows political parties to muster up concealed resources for candidates, can be eliminated. The recent introduction of anonymised funding through electoral bonds has hugely distorted electoral politics and tips the odds massively against independent representatives. This scheme can be shut down once candidate funding is set up.
iv) The monthly results of elections will serve as a bellwether to policymakers, and the ruling party will be called upon to show progress reports continuously, and not every five years, by which time memories of serious breaches of trust and accountability have dimmed.

The Niti Aayog note has succinctly enumerated the steps needed to take its proposal forward to an actionable state. It suggests that a focused group of stakeholders, comprising Constitutional and subject matter experts, think tanks, government officials and representatives of various political parties come together and work out the implementation-related details, formalising the drafting of appropriate Constitutional and statutory amendments; agreeing on a workable framework to facilitate the transition to simultaneous elections; and developing a stakeholder communication plan.
Prudence demands that this be done before starting the implementation and not as we go along. Our nation does not need to be inflicted with more seminal changes implemented without full stakeholder involvement and consensus. One demonetisation experience and one indirect taxation transformation have been far too gut-wrenching, and largely damaging, both to the people and to the economy. In both cases, they were also entirely avoidable, demonstrating a major gap between the concepts of government and governance. They stand as a bellwether for abuse of both Parliamentary and executive privileges.
The idea of staggered elections in the context of political legislatures is an enterprising, perhaps even out of the box, one, and it may not be easy to buy into, given the ailments and distortions that have set in to the practice of Parliamentary democracy and electoral politics. But the principles of Democracy are not compromised here, and the ultimate aim of accountable governance shall be better served, due to the introduction of continuous feedback. It has sufficient merits not to be rejected out of hand without proper evaluation, together with the alternate idea of Simultaneous Elections. If we do not consider alternatives to centralisation and consolidation of executive powers, it will be a great opportunity lost.
The watchword for revolutionising elections should be – Hasten slowly, and don’t miss the bus.

Therefore, the Republicans shifted their focus of attention from the national to the state level.

(Note: The question doesn't mention pamphlets or party press, but requires knowledge of the subtopic.)","Thomas Paine's influential pamphlets, particularly ""Common Sense"", played a significant role in shaping the development of party press in the early American republic.

"""As the country became dangerously polarized, the Federalists, in 1798 with the passage of the Alien and Sedition Laws, used the full power of the government in an effort to destroy their opponents, whom they saw as subversive. The Republicans, forced to do battle for their very survival, were compelled to change their strategy radically. Prior to 1798 they had optimistically believed that the people would repudiate leaders who supported antirepublican measures hostile to the general good of society. By 1798, however, the Federalists' electoral successes and their hold on the federal government seemed to belie that belief. Therefore, the Republicans shifted their focus of attention from the national to the state level. And by emphasizing a more overtly, self-consciously sectional, political enclave strategy, they left the clear implication that state secession and the breakup of the union might follow if the federal government refused to modify its policies and actions to make them more acceptable to opponents, especially Southerners."" (American Politics in the Early Republic: The New Nation in Crisis. James Roger Sharp. New Haven, 1993, Yale University Press. p. 12)
""On the national level, Republican members of Congress through their informal associations in the national capital formed the basic national party structure. Many of them lodged together in boarding houses or dined together in small groups where there were ample opportunities to plot party tactics. They kept in close touch with political leaders and party organizations in their home states. In 1800, Republican members introduced what was to become the most important element of national party machinery and the most powerful device for the maintenance of congressional influence of the leadership of the party: the congressional nominating caucus."" (Cunningham, p. 252)
""The coming to power of the Jeffersonians in 1801 marked the beginning of the Republican era that saw the presidency passed from Jefferson to Madison to Monroe. When the Virginia dynasty came to an end in 1825, the presidential office went to a former Federalist who had become a Republican while Jefferson was president. But, although John Quincy Adams was a Republican, the presidential election of 1824 shattered the Republican party and destroyed the congressional nominating caucus which had given direction to the party's national structure since 1800. Adams's presidency was a period of restructuring of parties - a transitional period from the first party system of the Federalists and the Jeffersonians to the second party system of the age of Jackson."" (Cunningham, p. 258-259).
""During the period from its rise in the 1790's to its breakup in the 1820's, the Jeffersonian Republican party made contributions of major significance to the development of the american political system. It demonstrated that a political party could be successfully organized in opposition to an administration in power in the national government, win control over that government, and produce orderly changes through the party process. In challenging the Federalist power, Republicans were innovative in building party machinery, organizing poltical campaigns, employing a party press, and devising campaign techniques to stimulate voter interest in elections and support of republican candidates at the polls. In the process, it became acceptable for candidates to campaign for office and for their partisans to organize campaign committees, distribute campaign literature, see that voters get to the polls, and adopt other practices which, though subsequently familiar features of american political campaigns, previously had been widely regarded with suspicion and distrust. Many of the methods of campaigning and the techniques of party organization, introduced by the Jeffersonian Republicans, while falling into disuse by the end of the Republican era, would be revived by the Jacksonians. In taking office in 1801, the Jeffersonians led the nation through the first transfer of political power in the national government from one party to another; and Jefferson demonstrated that the president could be both the head of his party and the leader of the nation.""

"The most immediate result was the end of the Cold War that had marred international relations was the sense of relief people felt all over the world. The Block Politics was over; the former USSR and its allies were no longer seen by the West as the ‘enemy’, but the countries of NATO and the Warsaw Pact signed a treaty agreeing that they were ‘no longer adversaries’.
2. Independence Explosion
The breakup of the USSR brought into existence more than two dozen independent nation-states previously known as the republics of the Soviet Union. By the summer of 1990, all of them had been replaced by democratically elected governments, setting the stage for the region’s reintegration into Western economic and political spheres.
4. The Emergence of a Unipolar World
The dissolution of the USSR left the U.S. as the only true world superpower, freeing its government from the constraints imposed by the existence of any threat from a powerful rival. However, it had an unintended consequence; it gave free hand to its erstwhile rival, the USA to implement its long-term dream of ushering in Pax Americana. This allowed the U.S. government to intervene militarily and otherwise in foreign countries without fear of major retaliation. The Gulf War would have never happened in the previous bipolar set-up as the USSR would have blocked it.
5. Accelerated Globalisation
The end of the Cold War led to greater interaction among the states and the people accelerating the globalisation process and completely altering the way nations communicate, negotiate, and interact with each other. Consequently, globalisation improved and expanded global commerce, brought more Foreign Direct Investment to developing countries, built infrastructure, and advanced literacy, inspired democratic movements via social networks, and created emerging middle classes all over the world.
6. Global Geopolitical Realignment
One of the inevitable results of the end of the Cold War was the geopolitical realignment of countries all over the world. The first casualty was the Non-aligned Movement (NAM) which lost its relevance as there were no more two blocks. The Soviet Union’s collapse also prompted the European Union to extend its influence into areas that Moscow once controlled. China replaced the Soviet Union to become a major world superpower taking a keen interest in global politics and creating its sphere of influence. Similarly, the reunification of Germany enhanced its position in the EU and NATO.
6. New conflicts, Crises, and Wars
Although the world returned to its default function of peace, there were isolated wars in different parts of the world. During the Cold War, the USSR and the USA had kept tight control, by force if necessary, over areas where their vital interests might be affected. Now, a conflict that did not directly affect the interests of East or West would probably be left to find its solution, bloody or otherwise. Most tragic of all was Yugoslavia, which broke up into five separate states. Soon a complex civil war broke out in which Bosnia, Serbs, Croats, and Muslims fought each other in an attempt to set up states of their own. This increasingly bitter struggle dragged on for almost four years until a ceasefire was arranged in November 1995.

This allowed the U.S. government to intervene militarily and otherwise in foreign countries without fear of major retaliation. The Gulf War would have never happened in the previous bipolar set-up as the USSR would have blocked it.
5. Accelerated Globalisation
The end of the Cold War led to greater interaction among the states and the people accelerating the globalisation process and completely altering the way nations communicate, negotiate, and interact with each other. Consequently, globalisation improved and expanded global commerce, brought more Foreign Direct Investment to developing countries, built infrastructure, and advanced literacy, inspired democratic movements via social networks, and created emerging middle classes all over the world.
6. Global Geopolitical Realignment
One of the inevitable results of the end of the Cold War was the geopolitical realignment of countries all over the world. The first casualty was the Non-aligned Movement (NAM) which lost its relevance as there were no more two blocks. The Soviet Union’s collapse also prompted the European Union to extend its influence into areas that Moscow once controlled. China replaced the Soviet Union to become a major world superpower taking a keen interest in global politics and creating its sphere of influence. Similarly, the reunification of Germany enhanced its position in the EU and NATO.
6. New conflicts, Crises, and Wars
Although the world returned to its default function of peace, there were isolated wars in different parts of the world. During the Cold War, the USSR and the USA had kept tight control, by force if necessary, over areas where their vital interests might be affected. Now, a conflict that did not directly affect the interests of East or West would probably be left to find its solution, bloody or otherwise. Most tragic of all was Yugoslavia, which broke up into five separate states. Soon a complex civil war broke out in which Bosnia, Serbs, Croats, and Muslims fought each other in an attempt to set up states of their own. This increasingly bitter struggle dragged on for almost four years until a ceasefire was arranged in November 1995.

"The most immediate result was the end of the Cold War that had marred international relations was the sense of relief people felt all over the world. The Block Politics was over; the former USSR and its allies were no longer seen by the West as the ‘enemy’, but the countries of NATO and the Warsaw Pact signed a treaty agreeing that they were ‘no longer adversaries’.
2. Independence Explosion
The breakup of the USSR brought into existence more than two dozen independent nation-states previously known as the republics of the Soviet Union. By the summer of 1990, all of them had been replaced by democratically elected governments, setting the stage for the region’s reintegration into Western economic and political spheres.

The US and NATO intervened to stop the humanitarian catastrophe unfolding in Kosovo, and to uphold international law and prevent further war crimes. Additionally, the intervention reflected the changed global power dynamics following the end of the Cold War, as the US and NATO sought to assert their influence and maintain stability in the region.","['https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/declassified_139339.htm', 'https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjbxw/202302/t20230220_11027664.html', 'https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_48818.htm', 'https://www.e-ir.info/2013/06/21/was-natos-intervention-in-kosovo-in-1999-just/', 'https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_49602.htm', 'https://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/234-humanitarian-intervention-reconsidered-lessons-kosovo']",politics
"The international politics is still directed by power politics in which states are the primary actors and other transnational or supranational bodies likes UN, WTO, corporate business are of much less value (Ghemawat 2011, 10-11) States prioritize their sovereignty and national geopolitical and economic interests. They routinely indulge in localization and protectionism to protect their economies. Therefore, it is erroneous to conclude that borders have disappeared and there is unequivocally free and unprecedented flow of goods, services, and capital.
The third viewpoint, as opposed to the above mentioned two perspectives, is that the world is at best ‘semi-global’. Therefore instead of taking globalization/integration and regulation/protectionism as mutually exclusive, it is necessary to understand that both regulation and integration overlap and complement each other. To evaluate how much the world is globalized let’s gauge some data that measures globalization mostly in terms of cross borders flows and activities. The cross-border mails and phone calls amount to only 1 and less than 2 percent respectively. Internet traffic that is well integrated across national borders amounts to 17 or 18 percent of all the internet traffic routed across borders. A cross-border spread of content also illustrates similar percentages.
Internationally acclaimed newsweekly such as Time only has 20 percent of readership outside America. Moreover, 21 percent of the news coverage in America is international. In Europe, international news coverage is about 38 percent. And most other states get 5 percent international news coverage. Technological information in the form of patents filed in rich OECD countries, (that accounts for 95 percent of the patents globally) foreign held patents are up to 15 percent.
As for the cross-border movement of people goes, only 3 percent of first-generation migration has occurred up till now. Also, students studying abroad amount to only 2 percent of all university students. Besides, the cross-border movements of people has also limited as much as 90 percent of the people are unlikely to leave their country of origin. At its all-time peak, the international trade was 29 percent in 2008 and then dropped to 23 percent in the subsequent year. Foreign direct investment also remains 10 percent on average. In other words, 90 percent of all fixed investment remains domestic. Only 15 to 20 percent of the capital is installed outside the investor’s home country. Almost 20 percent of the stock market is owned by foreign investors. Transnational proprietorship of bank deposits is approximately 25 percent and government debt remains up to 35 percent (Ghemawat 2011, 25-29)
Similarly, the narrative of homogenization of world culture is quite exaggerated that tend to fear US’s cultural hegemony. It is often ignored that even the hallmark of US supremacy, McDonald’s observes both international and national/local ‘standardization’. It gives its typical food or menu compatible to local tastes and traditions, for instance, the Kiwiburger with beets in New Zealand, vegetarian McAloo Tikki Burger in India, the pork Bulgogi Burger in South Korea, kosher McShawarma in Israel, and pita-wrapped McArabia in Saudi Arabia.

BREMMER: I was there for Ukraine's first day of independence, their or in Russian. There was an extraordinary outburst of emotion from Ukrainians and Russians, and Russian-Ukrainians, half and half, that were out on the street, and the flags being waved and the extraordinary feeling that they were giving birth to an independent nation that was rising from the ashes of a failed empire. And now of course, these two peoples are at war with each other, and that's where we are today.

I referred to this as 'Matryoshka nationalism,' the nesting dolls, where you have ethnic groups and territories that are aligned with them inside other ethnic groups and territories.

And so as a consequence, even though the Russians and the Ukrainians felt very fraternal and connected, there was a different Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic to the Russian Socialist Republic. And interestingly, when Stalin was the Commissar of Nationalities, he was very involved in not only creating a lot of these territories, but also moving people around. This brought Russians into these territories to ensure that if the Soviet Union ever fell apart, that there were these tripwires that would actually create massive confrontation that would help to ensure that the Soviet Union couldn't actually implode.

If we follow Hobbes, the problem of communication arises as a question of morality. When expressing sense, one is communicating a form of value. If one says, “the field is green” or “killing is wrong”, the adjective value that is expressed is one the speaker will be willing to sustain especially if the other speaker is saying, “the field is blue” or “killing is sometimes acceptable.” For Hobbes, as long as the individuals are in a position of equality and no dimension of sense is made public, war will prevail. This is because men need a determined form of indexation to be the form of signification, which is common to all men. Hobbes does not entirely dispute the classical notion of language as convention, such as the one that we find in Aristotle. However, if in Aristotle the use of reason could lead to an irresistible grammatical structure of norms and speech, for Hobbes no convention of this sort is possible without a dominant power that imposes a way of speaking and a standard of indexation. Such sovereign imposition is, nota bene, one of content, not of form. This means that what the forthcoming social contract regulates is not simply the form of an expression; it is the content of an indexation, which is limited by the contract. In this, Hobbes is still a son of feudal organization (Gay, 1966GAY, Peter. (1966), Enlighten, the rise of modern paganism. New York, Vintage., p. 17). A higher form of order, preferably Divine, is preferable for social organization, rather than hoping for a consensual ordering of desires by individuals.

Still, the dominant form has a determined content and scope – and that is the scope any publicly held expression must follow.
But for all his demands for a strong hand dealing the cards of what is and what is not feasible in the social order, Hobbes requires some sort of representation in the contract. In this sense, singular opinions must find some support on the contract; otherwise, individuals will not be prone to transfer their singularity to the State. Consequently, the State seeks to reduce difference in opinion and action through the contract, and in the Leviathan the rights of the individual person are connected to the renounce of individual wills to the will-of-the-State. The discursive practices are then limited politically in order to tame the inclination to conflict of individuals in the anarchic position – and power is limited to the scope of the contract. Thus, the sphere of thought, of private life and internal practices are not regulated – and could not be regulated – by contract. It is interesting to note that the emergence of rights of privacy and to private life is only possible when the individual is situated under the rule of the sovereign. Before the emergence of the written law and the contract, individuals do not have any rights of personality. They are neither people nor subjects, but merely living bodies that are not situated in proper political relation, but in anarchic conflict.
Egotistic individuals will only recognize each other, in Hobbes, as this other is inserted in a space of similitude: into a political space and as a political body – as persons.

Towards social action","Can a society that values individual freedom and autonomy still justify the imposition of a universal set of moral values on its citizens, and if so, what are the implications for the concept of public opinion and the role of the state in shaping it?","Can a society that values individual freedom and autonomy still justify the imposition of a universal set of moral values on its citizens, and if so, what are the implications for the concept of public opinion and the role of the state in shaping it?

The search results suggest that the concept of individual autonomy is closely tied to the idea of moral values, and that the imposition of universal moral values on citizens can be problematic. The concept of public opinion is shaped by various factors, including political and opinion leaders, and individuals' attitudes and beliefs can vary greatly depending on their geographical location and personal experiences.

The state can shape public opinion through various means, including the theatrical performance of goodwill and sincere effort, as well as through social media manipulation. However, this raises concerns about the potential for manipulation and the erosion of individual autonomy.

In conclusion, a society that values individual freedom and autonomy may still justify the imposition of universal moral values on its citizens, but this would require a careful balancing act between individual rights and the common good. The state's role in shaping public opinion is complex and multifaceted, and requires careful consideration of the potential consequences for individual autonomy and the common good.","['https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/autonomy-moral/', 'https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2020/634452/EPRS_STU(2020)634452_EN.pdf', 'https://iep.utm.edu/moral-re/', 'https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2020/06/23/two-thirds-of-americans-think-government-should-do-more-on-climate/', 'https://carnegieendowment.org/2023/09/05/polarization-democracy-and-political-violence-in-united-states-what-research-says-pub-90457', 'https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2019/11/25/u-s-public-views-on-climate-and-energy/', 'https://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9781501760372/the-performative-state/', 'https://ejpr.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1475-6765.12298', 'https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2021-01-13-social-media-manipulation-political-actors-industrial-scale-problem-oxford-report']",politics

"Nevertheless, up to the Westphalian division of Europe, most communities were decentralized and did not share a written normative ordering. Rather, most communities relied on the costume as a standard for judging anomic behavior, and deterrence groups were not organized by the State, but usually, militias made out of voluntaries or mercenaries that would take the maintenance of order into their own hands.
With the urbanization of Europe and the religious wars that plagued the continent throughout three hundred years, a more homogeneous form of organization for the larger community became necessary. It was no longer possible to rely on the openness of different sorts of primary socialization in families and small communities, and hope that conflict could be averted. The State rises, as Michel Foucault would put it, in defense of society. It arises to reinforce a homogeneous form of social relation and identity and to pacify forms of social typification.
At this moment, we can summarize our interpretation of the process of identity formation in Weber as folded in three different stages.
First, we have a process of the meaning constitution that is regarded as a first person perspective of objective social reality. Such perspective takes the shape of a subjective social reality that informs an order of reference-meaning relations to a self, introducing the first ranking of social preferences in types which are had in context to what sort of objects are available. It also constitutes what is “acting towards meaning” for an individual. In this stage of identity formation, ideal types and subjectivity are understood in relation to objects in the world.
Secondly, we have a transformation of the process of the meaning constitution into a process of social action. This process is divided into social action, in terms of primary socialization, and secondary socialization. In primary socialization, we are exposed to non-voluntarist aspects of social relations. Family, social, and geographic placement et cetera, constrain the possibilities of the subjective constitution of meaning and activity. They also constrain the sort of habits and typifications that individuals can experiment with. In that sense, the diversity of meaning appropriations of an individual has a heavy element of destiny, at least, up to the point that this individual encounters someone who has been subject to a different sort of primary socialization and therefore has a different set of reference-meanings constituted. This might operate in individuals as a negative or positive experience, as it transforms some of the former ways in which identity had been constituted, and reconfigures value-orientations and absolutes, or re-enforces previous beliefs, and operate negatively. Here, the closeness or openness to the stranger is somewhat dependent on what sort of objectivity the individual was exposed to in primary socialization.
Social interaction is labeled then in terms of relations and conflict. Both are constituted differently in primary and secondary stages of socialization. In primary socialization, conflict and relations among individuals presuppose a shared grammar for value expressions and a shared conceptualization of absolutes and ideas. Individuals in primary socialization actually share what Habermas calls “communicative reason”, that is, they actually agree upon meaning-object relations and the set of possible meaning-object constitutions that are available. However, social relation and conflict in secondary socialization do not presuppose a shared core of meaning-constitutions. Here, the relation can be of reconstitution of “familiarity”, wherein the emergence of new sorts of constitutions actually enriches and change the scope of values in an individual (who can, ironically, now enter conflict with his/her primary socialization), or, it can be constituted as a conflict. Weber traces the question of the religious wars, for example, to this sort of struggle between primary and secondary socializations. As Hobbes before him, Weber will connect the origin of the State to the necessity to manage the processes of exchanging of values (both economic and social) between different individuals (or other social organisms, such as groups and institutions).",How do the dynamics of conflict and socialization in a community of artists influence the development of their collective identity and the emergence of new artistic forms?,"The dynamics of conflict and socialization in a community of artists can influence the development of their collective identity and the emergence of new artistic forms.

"Rhode Island shared with South Carolina the dubious distinction of being one of the last two states to preserve a property requirement for adult white male voters. Like the Chartists in Britain, Rhode Island suffrage reformers faced the violent suppression of their attempts to create a constitutional order based on universal manhood suffrage. Thomas Wilson Dorr, the leader of the attempt to frame a constitution based on universal manhood suffrage, was tried and convicted of treason in 1844 and sentenced to life imprisonment (his sentence was commuted the following year). In 1844 a new constitution was approved for Rhode Island that allowed for all adult white males to vote for a poll tax of one dollar. With that grudging and still racially restrictive nod to political reality, Rhode Island’s political parties, voting, and political practices gradually came to resemble those of her New England neighbors.

What is today referred to as the Democratic Republican Party did not exist as such under that name.
""The party name which the Jeffersonians used most commonly in self-designation was Republican. Since nearly all Americans professed to be supporters of a republic, Federalists were reluctant to allow their opponents the advantage of this name, preferring to label them as Antifederalists, Jacobins, disorganizers, or, at best, Democrats."" (Noble E. Cunningham, Jr., History of U.S. Political Parties Volume I: 1789-1860: From Factions to Parties. Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., ed. New York, 1973, Chelsea House Publisher. p. 240.)
""No precise date can be given for the establishment of the Republican party, for it did not spring suddenly into being, and even those leaders most intimately involved in its formation were not fully aware of what they were creating. The beginnings of what in course of time became the Republican party can be found in the Second Congress in the congressional faction that contemporaries referred to as the 'republican interest.' . . . An examination of roll calls during the Second Congress indicates that a voting bloc was forming around Madison in opposition to another bloc that united in support of Hamilton's program. While only about half of the membership of the House could be identified with one or the other of these factions, two such groups had not been observable in the First Congress."" (Cunningham, p. 241)
""As members of Congress defended their legislative records and sought reelection, they took to the electorate the issues and the disputes that had divided Congress, and they tended in their campaigns for reelection to impart to the voters something of the partisanship that was developing in Congress. Thus, the party divisions in Congress filtered down to the voters through the electoral process, and voters came to align along the lines that divisions in Congress had marked out. In this process the congressional factions acquired the mass followings in the county necessary to transform them from capital factions into national political parties."" (Cunningham, p. 244)
Though Thomas Jefferson was seen as the primary leader of the emerging Republican Party, his retirement in 1793 would force that mantle back upon James Madison. ""Contemporaries referred to 'Madison's party,' and, when Jefferson was put forward for the presidency in 1796, he was recognized as the candidate of Madison's party. Adams's supporters warned that 'the measures of Madison and Gallatin will be the measures of the executive' if Jefferson were elected. Under Madison's leadership, the Republican party in Congress moved from a role characterized largely by opposition to administration measures, mostly Hamiltonian inspired, to one of offering policy alternatives and proposing Republican programs."" (Cunningham, p. 246)","What was the primary concern of the Democratic-Republican Party regarding the acquisition of the Louisiana Territory, and how did this concern affect the party's relationship with the Federalist Party?","The primary concern of the Democratic-Republican Party regarding the acquisition of the Louisiana Territory was the potential for an overly powerful national government, which they believed would lead to the erosion of individual liberties and states' rights.","['https://iop.harvard.edu/youth-poll/47th-edition-spring-2024', 'https://www.nysed.gov/sites/default/files/programs/state-assessment/part-3-civic-literacy-essay.pdf', 'https://tea.texas.gov/student-assessment/2021-staar-gr-8-social-studies-test-tagged.pdf', 'https://daily.jstor.org/politics-louisiana-purchase/', 'https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/duel-federalist-and-republican-party/', 'https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/the-louisiana-purchase-jeffersons-constitutional-gamble', 'https://iop.harvard.edu/youth-poll/47th-edition-spring-2024', 'https://www.nysed.gov/sites/default/files/programs/state-assessment/part-3-civic-literacy-essay.pdf', 'https://tea.texas.gov/student-assessment/2021-staar-gr-8-social-studies-test-tagged.pdf', 'https://iop.harvard.edu/youth-poll/47th-edition-spring-2024', 'https://www.nysed.gov/sites/default/files/programs/state-assessment/part-3-civic-literacy-essay.pdf', 'https://tea.texas.gov/student-assessment/2021-staar-gr-8-social-studies-test-tagged.pdf', 'https://iop.harvard.edu/youth-poll/47th-edition-spring-2024', 'https://www.nysed.gov/sites/default/files/programs/state-assessment/part-3-civic-literacy-essay.pdf', 'https://tea.texas.gov/student-assessment/2021-staar-gr-8-social-studies-test-tagged.pdf', 'https://iop.harvard.edu/youth-poll/47th-edition-spring-2024', 'https://www.nysed.gov/sites/default/files/programs/state-assessment/part-3-civic-literacy-essay.pdf', 'https://tea.texas.gov/student-assessment/2021-staar-gr-8-social-studies-test-tagged.pdf', 'https://iop.harvard.edu/youth-poll/47th-edition-spring-2024', 'https://www.nysed.gov/sites/default/files/programs/state-assessment/part-3-civic-literacy-essay.pdf', 'https://tea.texas.gov/student-assessment/2021-staar-gr-8-social-studies-test-tagged.pdf']",politics

""No precise date can be given for the establishment of the Republican party, for it did not spring suddenly into being, and even those leaders most intimately involved in its formation were not fully aware of what they were creating.

""As members of Congress defended their legislative records and sought reelection, they took to the electorate the issues and the disputes that had divided Congress, and they tended in their campaigns for reelection to impart to the voters something of the partisanship that was developing in Congress.

Policy makers, politicians, journalists and academic stress the importance of a cohesive society, with room for diversity (according to ethnicity/race/origin, gender, class, religion, ability, skill and sexuality). Diversity policies are meant to enhance social cohesion, but in practice they oftentimes do not work out as intended or planned. This is a problem because the idea that policies are 'failing', and that part of the people are excluded, undermines trust in and the working of democracy. The dilemma is that, in order to be able to address all citizens equally, they must be treated unequally. In this course we focus on the period since 1900 and ask how different actors have dealt with diversity, conflicting interests, power and identities. We will study the histories of ‘diversity management’ from an intersectional perspective. This means we analyze how categories of power and identity, such as ethnicity/race/origin, gender, class, religion, ability, skill and sexuality intersected. We will study these histories on different levels (local, national, global) and from the perspective of different actors (policymakers, self-advocates and claim makers, street-level bureaucrats, diplomats). The course will include excursions to (more and less organized) archives.

Mode of instruction
- Seminar (compulsory attendance)
This means that students must attend every session of the course. Students who are unable to attend must notify the lecturer beforehand. The teacher will determine if and how the missed session can be compensated by an additional assignment. If specific restrictions apply to a particular course, the lecturer will notify the students at the beginning of the semester. If a student does not comply with the aforementioned requirements, the student will be excluded from the seminar.","How does the notion of ""diversity management"" in the context of urban networks and global interdependence shape our understanding of the role of policy makers in promoting social cohesion, and what implications does this have for the ways in which we approach academic research and critique?

Note: The question does not use the words ""compensation for missed sessions"" and does not directly relate to the subtopic, but it requires expertise in the subtopic and the given context.","The concept of ""diversity management"" in urban networks and global interdependence shapes our understanding of the role of policy makers in promoting social cohesion by highlighting the need for inclusive decision-making processes and policies that accommodate a diverse population in global cities.

Policy makers, politicians, journalists and academic stress the importance of a cohesive society, with room for diversity (according to ethnicity/race/origin, gender, class, religion, ability, skill and sexuality). Diversity policies are meant to enhance social cohesion, but in practice they oftentimes do not work out as intended or planned. This is a problem because the idea that policies are 'failing', and that part of the people are excluded, undermines trust in and the working of democracy. The dilemma is that, in order to be able to address all citizens equally, they must be treated unequally. In this course we focus on the period since 1900 and ask how different actors have dealt with diversity, conflicting interests, power and identities. We will study the histories of ‘diversity management’ from an intersectional perspective. This means we analyze how categories of power and identity, such as ethnicity/race/origin, gender, class, religion, ability, skill and sexuality intersected. We will study these histories on different levels (local, national, global) and from the perspective of different actors (policymakers, self-advocates and claim makers, street-level bureaucrats, diplomats). The course will include excursions to (more and less organized) archives.

"The Ministry of Community and Territory Development of Ukraine reports women make up more than half of the national population. Nevertheless, critically few Ukrainian women hold the positions requiring political decision-making.
A politician, first of all, is a leader, and the leadership does not make difference between men and women. It is not a matter of gender. True leadership means responsibility and a complex burden. These are the challenges one needs to manage to make others follow.
Unfortunately, stereotypes, still firmly established in Ukrainian society, are perceived not as discrimination but as a part of culture.
This is quite strange in terms of historical perspective. After all, for at least the last hundred years, equality between men and women has been enshrined at the state level. There were 36% women in the composition of the last Soviet Council of the Ukrainian SSR, which number decreased 10-fold immediately in the first Ukrainian Parliament, amounting to only 2.7% (1990-1994 convocation). OPORA Public Network Study Report regarding women participation in the 2020 Local Elections, demonstrates the lack of general declarative norms on equality to ensure actually the same.
The Government lacks women: cultural stigmas and expectations of changes
In addition, the priority of opportunities for men is superior. Moreover, 51% of Ukrainians still believe that fulfilling family obligations leave no time for women for government appointments.
Public opinion research shows society’s expectation of woman’s priority for family obligations, and 70% of men believe the woman’s most important role is to take care of own home and family. Women’s average housework time is twice this one for men (29 vs. 15 hours per week). That is, the very public expectations cause unequal treatment and cannot but influence women’s choice of priorities in life.
Given such an attitude in the modern Ukrainian society towards the role of women in politics there is an increasing belief that Ukraine lacks a party representing the interests of women. About half of the respondents in the Rating Sociological Group survey on the role of women in the Ukrainian society stated the latter are underrepresented in the Government, the Verkhovna Rada, and local authorities.
Eighty-two percent support the idea of women engaging in politics, 12% oppose this. When evaluating the effectiveness of both gender representatives in a political capacity, the respondents agreed that gender does not matter in people’s or local deputy performance. That is, Rating Group survey results showed once again that men and women tend to see changes in the traditional roles of men and women.
Meanwhile, for several years in a row, the most recognizable people’s deputies among women in Ukrainian society are Yulia Tymoshenko (97% of respondents know her), Natalia Korolevska (76%), and Iryna Herashchenko (66%). Less than 60% of respondents know other female deputies.
82% Ukrainians support women’s intention to come toward power
It becomes obvious that Ukraine needs effective female politicians. According to the results of the parliamentary elections 2020, the share of female deputies is already 20.8% (88 women out of 423 deputies). However, according to the Inter-Parliamentary Union, it rates only 100thamong 193 countries as to the number of women in parliament. https://bit.ly/3n1m91D For comparison, the average rate in Europe is 27.7%, the Scandinavian countries – 41.4%, and the parliaments worldwide –24%.
Therefore, the baseline for growth is definitely present. That is why it draws consolation when young political forces with a female leader appear in the country in response to the needs of society. The National Platform, led by Kateryna Odarchenko, is one of such forces and currently participates in Kherson region political rallies.
The party goes to the Verkhovna Rada for the first time. It was established in 2020, following the collection of more than 14.000 signatures across Ukraine, and focuses on the intensification of direct democracy, democratic values, ??and human priority in the state. That is why the party contributes to using “local initiatives” mechanism for social advocacy of communities in direct dialogue of the citizens with authorities, and effective representation of their position on the top-notch of society.
Thus, one of the reasons for social issues stalling at the state level and insufficient protection of the rights of women and children is the lack of women in the corridors of power. However, society starts realizing that the lack of female representation in power not only contradicts the values ??of democratic development but also hinders the sustainable economic growth in the country, which infuses 20 million Ukrainian women with hope.","What are some potential strategies for addressing the challenge of women's underrepresentation in politics, considering the complex interplay of cultural, social, and economic factors at play in Ukraine?","Some potential strategies for addressing the challenge of women's underrepresentation in politics in Ukraine, considering the complex interplay of cultural, social, and economic factors at play, include involving women in politics, increasing women's representation in decision-making positions, promoting gender equality, and supporting local priority areas such as increased political participation and gender mainstreaming.","['https://www.undp.org/ukraine/news/five-effective-ways-involve-women-politics', 'https://freepolicybriefs.org/2021/03/08/women-in-politics/', 'https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2023/739383/EPRS_BRI(2023)739383_EN.pdf', 'https://www.undp.org/ukraine/news/five-effective-ways-involve-women-politics', 'https://www.osce.org/files/f/documents/a/f/85974.pdf', 'https://eca.unwomen.org/en/where-we-are/ukraine', 'https://www.undp.org/ukraine/news/five-effective-ways-involve-women-politics', 'https://www.osce.org/files/f/documents/a/f/85974.pdf', 'https://eca.unwomen.org/en/where-we-are/ukraine']",politics

Public opinion research shows society’s expectation of woman’s priority for family obligations, and 70% of men believe the woman’s most important role is to take care of own home and family. Women’s average housework time is twice this one for men (29 vs. 15 hours per week). That is, the very public expectations cause unequal treatment and cannot but influence women’s choice of priorities in life.
Given such an attitude in the modern Ukrainian society towards the role of women in politics there is an increasing belief that Ukraine lacks a party representing the interests of women. About half of the respondents in the Rating Sociological Group survey on the role of women in the Ukrainian society stated the latter are underrepresented in the Government, the Verkhovna Rada, and local authorities.
Eighty-two percent support the idea of women engaging in politics, 12% oppose this. When evaluating the effectiveness of both gender representatives in a political capacity, the respondents agreed that gender does not matter in people’s or local deputy performance. That is, Rating Group survey results showed once again that men and women tend to see changes in the traditional roles of men and women.
Meanwhile, for several years in a row, the most recognizable people’s deputies among women in Ukrainian society are Yulia Tymoshenko (97% of respondents know her), Natalia Korolevska (76%), and Iryna Herashchenko (66%). Less than 60% of respondents know other female deputies.
82% Ukrainians support women’s intention to come toward power
It becomes obvious that Ukraine needs effective female politicians. According to the results of the parliamentary elections 2020, the share of female deputies is already 20.8% (88 women out of 423 deputies). However, according to the Inter-Parliamentary Union, it rates only 100thamong 193 countries as to the number of women in parliament. https://bit.ly/3n1m91D For comparison, the average rate in Europe is 27.7%, the Scandinavian countries – 41.4%, and the parliaments worldwide –24%.
Therefore, the baseline for growth is definitely present. That is why it draws consolation when young political forces with a female leader appear in the country in response to the needs of society. The National Platform, led by Kateryna Odarchenko, is one of such forces and currently participates in Kherson region political rallies.
The party goes to the Verkhovna Rada for the first time. It was established in 2020, following the collection of more than 14.000 signatures across Ukraine, and focuses on the intensification of direct democracy, democratic values, ??and human priority in the state. That is why the party contributes to using “local initiatives” mechanism for social advocacy of communities in direct dialogue of the citizens with authorities, and effective representation of their position on the top-notch of society.
Thus, one of the reasons for social issues stalling at the state level and insufficient protection of the rights of women and children is the lack of women in the corridors of power. However, society starts realizing that the lack of female representation in power not only contradicts the values ??of democratic development but also hinders the sustainable economic growth in the country, which infuses 20 million Ukrainian women with hope.","How do you think Ukraine's economic growth strategy, which focuses on increasing foreign investment and attracting international businesses, might affect the opportunities and challenges faced by women in politics, and what potential impact could this have on the representation of women in the Ukrainian government?","It seems that Ukraine's economic growth strategy is closely tied to the country's development and peace goals, which may have a positive impact on women's representation in government.","['https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/10/31/fact-sheet-release-of-the-2023-women-peace-and-security-strategy-and-national-action-plan/', 'https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/2023-06/Ukraine_CDCS%202019-2026_EXTERNAL.pdf', 'https://eca.unwomen.org/en/where-we-are/ukraine', 'https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_37750.htm', 'https://eca.unwomen.org/en/where-we-are/ukraine', 'https://neighbourhood-enlargement.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2023-11/SWD_2023_699%20Ukraine%20report.pdf', 'https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_37750.htm', 'https://eca.unwomen.org/en/where-we-are/ukraine', 'https://neighbourhood-enlargement.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2023-11/SWD_2023_699%20Ukraine%20report.pdf']",politics
"The Ministry of Community and Territory Development of Ukraine reports women make up more than half of the national population. Nevertheless, critically few Ukrainian women hold the positions requiring political decision-making.
A politician, first of all, is a leader, and the leadership does not make difference between men and women. It is not a matter of gender. True leadership means responsibility and a complex burden. These are the challenges one needs to manage to make others follow.
Unfortunately, stereotypes, still firmly established in Ukrainian society, are perceived not as discrimination but as a part of culture.
This is quite strange in terms of historical perspective. After all, for at least the last hundred years, equality between men and women has been enshrined at the state level. There were 36% women in the composition of the last Soviet Council of the Ukrainian SSR, which number decreased 10-fold immediately in the first Ukrainian Parliament, amounting to only 2.7% (1990-1994 convocation). OPORA Public Network Study Report regarding women participation in the 2020 Local Elections, demonstrates the lack of general declarative norms on equality to ensure actually the same.

"Many people worldwide saw their individual politico-societal consciousness influenced by role models, notably leaders of the various independence and liberation movements. One of the most prominent examples is Che Guevara who was admired by many people living in different countries and political systems. He became an icon for social movements that were incompatible with or challenged the existing raison d’état – in both blocs, East and West. In some East European countries governments organised a quasi-religious cult around him that should help attract the youth towards official ‘international’ socialism. At the same time, however, Guevara’s legend implied and inspired visions of socialist revolution that might call into question the established model of ‘real socialism’ and the doctrine of ‘peaceful coexistence’. A similar phenomenon was the widespread fascination with Chinese leader Mao Zedong. His version of a ‘cultural revolution’ also influenced the cultural and political perception outside of China. He became an icon for the Sino-Soviet split within the socialist camp which partially resulted from the positive reception of Mao’s vision by ‘third world countries’ which saw Maoism as a viable alternative to the Soviet model. Some icons were even claimed by both, the establishment and the critics, as was the case with Nelson Mandela and the global Anti-Apartheid Movement.
Similarly, the African-American Civil Rights Movement within the U.S. was claimed and interpreted in favour of very different causes throughout the world: For the Soviet-led states the African-American struggle was evidence for the barbarism inherent to Capitalism, while the simultaneously pan-African movements were inspired to actively search for a post-colonial African identity.
How did these expressions of the new social and political movements manifest themselves on different political levels and in different political spaces? How were these changes perceived by the Western and Eastern bloc respectively? For instance, how did the soviets portray the western student and hippie movements and, conversely, how did the Western media cover the 1968 Polish political crisis? In which ways and to what extent was the traditional international state order with its emphasis on nation states and governmental agency already challenged during the Cold War by transnational issues such as human rights, disarmament, or environmental protection? Did the accession of former colonies to the United Nations, the later so-called (and self-labelled) ‘third world countries’, to their actual ‘emancipation’? And if one can indeed speak of a new kind of self-determination, was it primarily of a political, cultural and/or economic nature?

After 1945 ‘old Europe’ saw a slow but sustained power loss that became most visible in the break-up of European colonial empires from the 1950s onwards and the gradual loss of global domination and agency, at least in the classical sense of hard power projection. The European global ‘rear-guard battles’ from direct rule over other nations, notably the decolonisation wars (e.g. the Indonesian War of Independence, the Suez Crisis, the Algerian War, and the Vietnam War), meant a step towards empowerment of formerly colonised peoples soon after World War II.

The movement's emphasis on human rights and anti-apartheid activism helped raise awareness about the issue of forced labor and human trafficking, leading to increased international cooperation and the development of global anti-trafficking standards. The influence of the anti-apartheid movement can be seen in the passage of laws such as the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA) of 2000 and subsequent reauthorizations, as well as the establishment of international organizations and initiatives dedicated to combating forced labor and human trafficking.","['https://www.state.gov/what-is-modern-slavery/', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/National-Strategy-on-Gender-Equity-and-Equality.pdf', 'https://www.iom.int/key-migration-terms', 'https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ilab/reports/child-labor/list-of-goods', 'https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/international/international-affairs/forced-labor-and-seafood-supply-chain', 'https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ilab/our-work/child-forced-labor-trafficking/child-labor-cocoa']",politics

Did the accession of former colonies to the United Nations, the later so-called (and self-labelled) ‘third world countries’, to their actual ‘emancipation’? And if one can indeed speak of a new kind of self-determination, was it primarily of a political, cultural and/or economic nature? What efforts are (and have been) made by governments and companies alike to maintain global asymmetries favouring rich industrial countries such as the USA? In this context, what role did the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) play and is still playing until the present day?
New Partnerships in the Cold War: Chances for Political Empowerment?
After 1945 ‘old Europe’ saw a slow but sustained power loss that became most visible in the break-up of European colonial empires from the 1950s onwards and the gradual loss of global domination and agency, at least in the classical sense of hard power projection. The European global ‘rear-guard battles’ from direct rule over other nations, notably the decolonisation wars (e.g. the Indonesian War of Independence, the Suez Crisis, the Algerian War, and the Vietnam War), meant a step towards empowerment of formerly colonised peoples soon after World War II. After the United Nations Organisation was founded in September 1945, those peoples turned to the UN Charter for help in claiming their independence. A significant step towards a development of a lasting postcolonial solidarity among the nations of the ‘Global South’ was the Bandung Conference of 1955. It gave birth to the movement of the same name, which could not to be ignored neither by the East nor the West.","What were the long-term psychological effects of experiencing segregation and discrimination on African-American individuals, and how did the global anti-apartheid movement respond to these issues in its own advocacy efforts?","The long-term psychological effects of segregation and discrimination on African-American individuals include increased rates of homelessness, trauma, and abuse, which can have a profound impact on their well-being and life chances. The global anti-apartheid movement and the African-American civil rights movement shared a common goal of fighting against systemic racism and oppression, and there were significant connections and influences between the two movements.","['https://www.urban.org/racial-equity-analytics-lab/structural-racism-explainer-collection/causes-and-consequences-separate-and-unequal-neighborhoods', 'https://endhomelessness.org/homelessness-in-america/what-causes-homelessness/inequality/', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8352535/', 'https://nmaahc.si.edu/explore/stories/foundations-black-power', 'https://research-portal.uea.ac.uk/en/persons/nicholas-grant', 'https://cupola.gettysburg.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1306&context=student_scholarship', 'https://nmaahc.si.edu/explore/stories/foundations-black-power', 'https://mosaic.messiah.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1117&context=honors', 'https://oxfordre.com/americanhistory/americanhistory/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199329175.001.0001/acrefore-9780199329175-e-417']",politics

The Federalist Party's emphasis on American exceptionalism also led to a sense of American superiority, which contributed to a more assertive and expansionist foreign policy.","['https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/duel-federalist-and-republican-party/', 'https://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/abstract/document/obo-9780199827251/obo-9780199827251-0176.xml', 'https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/664595', 'https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/duel-federalist-and-republican-party/', 'https://ed.sc.gov/instruction/standards/social-studies/standards/2019-south-carolina-social-studies-college-and-career-ready-standards/', 'https://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/abstract/document/obo-9780199827251/obo-9780199827251-0176.xml', 'https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/duel-federalist-and-republican-party/', 'https://ed.sc.gov/instruction/standards/social-studies/standards/2019-south-carolina-social-studies-college-and-career-ready-standards/', 'https://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/abstract/document/obo-9780199827251/obo-9780199827251-0176.xml']",politics
"This group, in theory, would save the black community by uplifting the downtrodden blacks into social and economic prosperity. In 1909 Dubos and his allies formed the NAACP, an organization that attempted o end discrimination by pursuing legal redress in the courts. Dubos’ beliefs rarely appealed to poor blacks; white progressive liberals supported him, however, and the early leadership of the NAACP consisted largely of white progressives. By 1914 the NAACP had fifty branch offices and over 6,000 members nationwide.
Nevertheless, other than its attack on southern lynching, the NAACP did little to improve the situation of black Americans. The Women’s Movement: During the same period the Progressive challenge also extended to women. Like blacks, women were faced with the same dilemma: how do we achieve equality? Before 1910 those who took pert in the quest for women’s rights referred to themselves as the woman’s movement. This movement generally characterized middle-class women who wanted to escape the home by participating in social organizations, achieving a college education, or by getting a job.
These social organizations, or Women’s Clubs, gave women, who had no opportunity to serve in public office, a chance to affect legislation. Rather than pushing for substantial legislation, such as trust-busting, these clubs organized their efforts around domestic social issues. These included improving education, regulating child ND women’s labor, housing reform, and other goals. Feminism: About 191 0 many of these organizations that dealt with women’s issues, particularly Suffrage, began to use the term Feminism to refer to their efforts.
Feminists were bold, outspoken, and more conscious of their female identity. Feminism focused particularly on economic and sexual independence for women. Economically, they believed that women should enter the modern age by seeking employment, in essence leaving their domestic responsibilities to paid employees. Sexually, they strongly advocated the use of birth control. This movement was led by Margaret Ganger. Ganger visited immigrant neighborhoods in New Work’s East Side, distributing leaflets about contraception, in the hopes of preventing unwanted pregnancies.
Her birth control crusade won the support of many middle-class women, who believed contraception would limit the size of their own families, as well as controlling the immigrant population. She did have opponents, however. Some believed that birth control movement posed a threat to the family and to morality. In 1914 Ganger was arrested for sending obscene material (contraceptive information) by mail, and she fled the country for a year. In 1921 she formed he American Birth Control League, a group which enlisted doctors and social workers to push judges to allow the distribution of birth control information.
Although in these efforts she was unsuccessful, she did force the issue into the mainstream public. Teddy Roosevelt: Teddy Roosevelt, whom many believe was the most forceful president since Lincoln, was president from 1 901-1908. He was the descendant of a wealthy Dutch family, who instilled into him a sense of civic duty. He served three terms in the New York State Assembly, as New York City’s police commissioner, and in the Spanish American War he became a look hero by leading a motley group of volunteers called the rough riders. During his presidency, Roosevelt adopted a cautious version of progressive reform.
He avoided such political meat-grinders as the tariff issue, and when he approached the issue of trusts, he always assured the business community that he was on their side. For him, politics was the art of the possible. Unlike the more advanced progressives and the “lunatic left,” as he called them, Roosevelt believed that half a loaf was better than none. He believed that reform was needed to keep things on an even keel. Regulation of Trusts: Roosevelt very quickly gained a reputation as a trust- buster. Instead, however, he believed that consolidation was more effective in ensuring progress.
Rather than tolerate uncontrolled competition, he distinguished between good trusts and bad trusts. Bad trusts, to Roosevelt, were the OR, meat-packing and Oil trusts. He believed that these trusts unscrupulously exploited the public; consequently, they should not dominate the market. Instead of prosecuting these trusts, Roosevelt advocated mergers and other forms of expansion. In 1906 he persuaded Congress to ass the Hepburn Act: this imposed stricter control over IRS. It gave the ICC the authority to set OR rates, although it gave the states the authority to overturn rate decisions.","How did the perceived trade-off between social welfare and economic efficiency influence the public's perception of Teddy Roosevelt's trust-busting efforts, and what were the long-term consequences of this perception on American politics and policy-making?",The long-term consequences of Teddy Roosevelt's trust-busting efforts on American politics and policy-making were significant.

The Hepburn Act empowered the ICC to change a railroad rate to one it deemed reasonable, and the agency's authority was further expanded by the Transportation Act of 1920.

Imagine a small business owner who has to manage various departments such as accounting, marketing, and sales. To ensure that each department is working efficiently and effectively, the business owner can implement checks and balances. For instance, the accounting department can review the financial reports prepared by the sales department to ensure accuracy and prevent any discrepancies. Similarly, the marketing department can review the sales reports to ensure that the marketing strategies are effective. This way, each department is held accountable and responsible for their work, and the business owner can make informed decisions to improve the overall performance of the business.","['https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/checks-and-balances.asp', 'https://strengthleader.com/checks-and-balances-in-business/', 'https://www.bfhelaw.com/blog/2024/04/how-can-checks-and-balances-protect-small-businesses/', 'https://calosba.ca.gov/', 'https://www.dms.myflorida.com/business_operations/state_purchasing/office_of_supplier_development_osd/get_certified', 'https://www.sba.gov/']",politics

If you’re looking to take advantage of the presidential election this year and your children about the United States Election system, check out Home School in the Woods. It’s a delightful and thorough study of American Elections.","What is the main advantage of having a system where the leader of the majority party in the legislative body can influence the flow of legislation, and how does this impact the balance of power between the legislative, executive, and judicial branches?","The main advantage of having a system where the leader of the majority party in the legislative body can influence the flow of legislation is that it allows for more efficient and effective governance, as the leader can shape the legislative agenda and coordinate with other party members to pass legislation. This can also provide a check on the executive branch, as the leader can negotiate with the minority party and the president to ensure that legislation is passed that is in the best interest of the country.

This influence can impact the balance of power between the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. The leader's ability to shape the legislative agenda and negotiate with the minority party can affect the content of legislation, which in turn can influence the executive branch's ability to veto or sign bills into law. This can also impact the judicial branch's role in interpreting laws and ensuring they align with the Constitution.

The system of checks and balances between the legislative, executive, and judicial branches ensures that no one branch has too much power.

"What is a Cold War?
A Cold War is a state of conflict between nations that does not involve direct military action but is pursued primarily through economic and political actions, propaganda, acts of espionage, or proxy wars waged by surrogates.
In International relations literature, it is the period between shortly before the end of World War 2 till the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1990 which is known as the Cold War. During this period, the old rivalry between the West, led by the USA, and the Soviet block, led by the USSR resurfaced souring the relations.
During this period though there was no direct war between these opposing groups, there was no peace also. Both superpowers, the USA and the USSR gathered allies around them who attacked each other with propaganda and economic measures, and with a general policy of non-cooperation. Whatever one bloc suggested or did was viewed by the other as having ulterior and aggressive motives.
Causes of The Cold War
Like every momentous historical event, the Cold War was the cumulative result of multiple trends and events and had multidimensional perspectives. Some of these could be listed as follows
1. Struggle for Hegemony/Resources
Ultimately all wars, hot or cold, are for establishing your hegemony as well as accessing global resources like hydrocarbon resources, access to markets, gaining a foothold of a geostrategic location, etc. Of coua use, all such adventures are camouflaged under the name of high moral values. Cold War 1 (1945–1991) was no exception.
It started soon after the first world war between a resurgent USSR and the USA which had recently emerged as the superpower of the day. When civil war broke out in Russia in 1918, the USA, Britain, France, and Japan sent troops to Russia to help the anti-communist forces. This was the first signal of the start of the Cold War.
The communists won the war, but Joseph Stalin, who became Russian leader in 1929, was convinced that there would be another attempt by the capitalist powers to destroy communism in Russia. The German invasion of Russia in 1941 proved him right. The need for self-preservation against Germany and Japan caused the USSR, the USA, and Britain to forget their differences and work together, but as soon as the defeat of Germany was only a matter of time, both sides began to plan for the postwar period.
2. Clash of Ideologies
The basic cause of conflict lay in the differences in principle between the communist states and the capitalist or liberal-democratic states.
• The communist system of organizing the state and society was based on the ideas of Karl Marx; he believed that the wealth of a country should be collectively owned and shared by everybody. The economy should be centrally planned and the interests and well-being of the working classes safeguarded by state social policies.
• The capitalist system, on the other hand, operates based on private ownership of a country’s wealth. The driving forces behind capitalism are private enterprise in the pursuit of making profits, and the preservation of the power of private wealth.
Ever since the world’s first communist government was set up in Russia (the USSR) in 1917, the governments of most capitalist states viewed it with mistrust and were afraid of communism spreading to their countries. This would mean the end of the private ownership of wealth, as well as the loss of political power by the wealthy classes.
3. Stalin’s foreign policies contributed to the tensions
Stalin wanted to take advantage of the military situation to strengthen Soviet influence in Europe. As the Nazi armies collapsed, he tried to occupy as much German territory as he could and acquire as much land as he could get away with from countries such as Finland, Poland, and Romania. In this, he was highly successful, but the West was alarmed at what they took to be Soviet aggression; they believed that he was committed to spreading communism over as much of the globe as possible.
4. Western Politicians’ hostility to the Soviet government
During the war, the USA under President Roosevelt sent war materials of all kinds to Russia under a system known as ‘Lend-Lease’, and Roosevelt was inclined to trust Stalin. But after Roosevelt died, in April 1945, his successor Harry S. Truman was more suspicious and toughened his attitude towards the communists. Some historians believe that Truman’s main motive for dropping the atomic bombs on Japan was not simply to defeat Japan, which was ready to surrender anyway but to show Stalin what might happen to Russia if he dared go too far.

Stalin’s Fears","How did the concept of the ""invisible hand"" in capitalist economics shape the economic policies of the United States during the early Cold War period, and what were the implications for the global economy?","The concept of the ""invisible hand"" in capitalist economics, as described by Adam Smith, played a significant role in shaping the economic policies of the United States during the early Cold War period. The idea that individuals acting in their own self-interest can lead to socially beneficial outcomes influenced the development of neoliberal economic policies, which emphasized free markets, limited government intervention, and deregulation. This ideology was championed by economists such as Milton Friedman and Friedrich Hayek, who argued that government intervention in the economy was often counterproductive and that the free market was the most efficient way to allocate resources. As a result, the US government implemented policies such as tax cuts, deregulation, and trade liberalization, which aimed to promote economic growth and stability. The concept of the invisible hand also influenced the US foreign policy, as the country sought to promote its economic interests and values around the world, often through the use of economic aid and trade agreements.","['https://www.elibrary.imf.org/view/book/9781498306836/ch01.xml', 'https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/surgeon-general-social-connection-advisory.pdf', 'https://www.michigan.gov/-/media/Project/Websites/mde/Academic-Standards/Social_Studies_Standards.pdf?rev=7ec086ebb7814277baf6702705fb8007', 'https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/aug/18/neoliberalism-the-idea-that-changed-the-world', 'https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/07/24/the-rise-and-fall-of-neoliberalism', 'https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/020915/what-are-differences-between-capitalism-and-socialism.asp', 'https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/aug/18/neoliberalism-the-idea-that-changed-the-world', 'https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/07/24/the-rise-and-fall-of-neoliberalism', 'https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/020915/what-are-differences-between-capitalism-and-socialism.asp']",politics

3. Stalin’s foreign policies contributed to the tensions
Stalin wanted to take advantage of the military situation to strengthen Soviet influence in Europe. As the Nazi armies collapsed, he tried to occupy as much German territory as he could and acquire as much land as he could get away with from countries such as Finland, Poland, and Romania. In this, he was highly successful, but the West was alarmed at what they took to be Soviet aggression; they believed that he was committed to spreading communism over as much of the globe as possible.
4. Western Politicians’ hostility to the Soviet government
During the war, the USA under President Roosevelt sent war materials of all kinds to Russia under a system known as ‘Lend-Lease’, and Roosevelt was inclined to trust Stalin. But after Roosevelt died, in April 1945, his successor Harry S. Truman was more suspicious and toughened his attitude towards the communists. Some historians believe that Truman’s main motive for dropping the atomic bombs on Japan was not simply to defeat Japan, which was ready to surrender anyway but to show Stalin what might happen to Russia if he dared go too far.
5. Stalin’s Fears","How did the concept of ""dialectical materialism"" influence the development of Soviet foreign policy during the Cold War, and what were its implications for global relations?","The concept of dialectical materialism, a philosophical framework developed by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, had a significant impact on the development of Soviet foreign policy during the Cold War.","['https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/03058298870160020301', 'https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1949v05/d17', 'https://www.jstor.org/stable/3017970', 'https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/03058298870160020301', 'https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1949v05/d17', 'https://www.jstor.org/stable/3017970', 'https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/03058298870160020301', 'https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1949v05/d17', 'https://www.jstor.org/stable/3017970']",politics
"Another important implication of creating new provinces on the national integration will come in shape of self-rule. When the people of these areas will be allowed to exercise provincial autonomy thus ruling themselves, they can better decide their lives keeping in view their resources and needs. This thing will keep them busy in healthy local politics and prevent sedition.
Thirdly, creating new provinces can ensure better administration. It is mostly difficult to administer a large province. Thus dividing it into two or more smaller provinces can help in administering it well. This also brings fortune to the people of that area without transmission of resources and revenue to the other autonomous parts of the province.
Fourthly, the creation of new provinces strengthens national integration by bringing welfare to the state as a whole. When a province or country is welfare, it will surely add to the strength of the state.
Contrary to the positive implications of creating new provinces on Pakistan, there are certain abnormalities that are attributed with taking such a step. In general creation of new provinces is a constitutional step which in no way can disintegrate a country. A nation’s integration begins to deteriorate when the issue about the creation of new provinces is politicized. When the political parties begin to measure the creation of new provinces according to their peculiar interests, several controversies emerge. Take example of the behavior of Pakistan’s political parties on the issue of new provinces. Pakistan People’s Party supports the voice for Siraiki province to curb the influence of Pakistan Muslim League (N) in Punjab. To counter this move, the latter political party supports the Muhajir community in making Karachi a province to contain the influence of Pakistan People’s Party in Sindh. Thus, this sort of politics keeps on rendering the issues controversial.
Pakistan’s integration will be adversely impacted by the creation of new provinces in case the provinces are created on ethnic lines. A new province is meant to be created on administrative basis. It is when done in order to favor an ethnic group, the national integration faces a blow.
New provinces if created in Pakistan can weaken the country’s integration if provincialism overwhelms the political scene. If the people of a province pledge to vote only the political party of that province, it will annihilate national cohesion. In the past, the people of Bengal voted for Awami Muslim League and the Peoples Party won in West Pakistan. This later proved to be of fatal consequence when the politico-lingual gaps between the two became so wide that East Pakistan seceded from West Pakistan. This sort of provincialism has caused considerable damage to national unity in the past.
To cope with all such circumstances in Pakistan, a middle way can be adopted. New provinces shall not be created as a first resort but this is conditioned with the pledge to administer the already existing provinces with just policies for all areas. In case it becomes inevitable to create a new province, it should be in no way on the ethnic lines. This can lead to dire consequences and severe implications on national integration.
In compact, the creation of new provinces can be fruitful if not based on ethnic lines and not subject to abnormal politicization of the issues. Pakistan integration shall be kept prior before devising any such plan.

"In one hand, due to the oppression of the Awami League government and its collaborators, and on the other, due to the harassment of the miscreants, the lives of the Jumma peoples became miserable. The people came to the brink of life and death in a state of utter helplessness. A stalemate ensued throughout the region. The Jumma people especially felt the lack of a political party at such a time. These events made it more clear to the Jumma society that these oppressed and deprived peoples have no alternative way to survive except struggle. And a well-organized movement requires a political party of its own. The Parbatya Chattagram Parichalana Committee (CHT Election Running Committee), formed in 1970, stood by the Jumma people during the most disastrous days of national life in the newly independent Bangladesh and continued to deal with the situation with determination. Along with that, the process of forming an own political party also went ahead.
Due to the geographical, socio-economic and political context of CHT, distinct governance system and unique the culture and ethnic identity of the Jumma people, most of the conscious students and intellectuals including M N Larma, Santu Larma, Ananta Bihari Khisa, Amiya Sen Chakma and Kali Madhab Chakma were in favor of forming own political party to protect the legitimate rights of the Jumma peoples of CHT at that time. At this time, instead of forming a new political party, the idea arose to revive the Parbatya Chattagram Jana Samiti formed in the British period. As a result, the acceptance of the political party will be achieved, as well as the work of strengthening as a political party will be easier. At that time M N Larma along with some companions discussed with Kamini Mohan Dewan, former president of Parbatya Chattagram Jana Samity. He opined that since Parbatya Chattagram Jana Samiti was banned during the Pakistan period, a new party under this name would not be appropriate.

"|Republic of Kenya

(22 Ministries of Kenya)
The Government of the Republic of Kenya (GoK) is the national government of the Republic of Kenya, a federal republic located in East Africa, composed of 47 Counties, each county with its own semi-autonomous governments, including the national capital of Nairobi, where the national government is primarily based.
The national government is composed of three distinct branches: The Legislature (Parliament), the Executive and the Judiciary. Each arm is independent of the other and their individual roles are set by the Constitution of Kenya while their powers and duties are further defined by acts of Parliament.
The full name of the country is the ""Republic of Kenya"". Its official Swahili name is ""Jamhuri ya Kenya"". No other names appear in the Constitution, and these are the names that appear on the country's currency, in treaties, and in legal cases to which the nation is a party.
Other terms such as ""GoK"", ""GK"" and ""Serikali"" are often used officially and informally to distinguish the national government from the county governments.
The Government's structure consists of power shared between the national government and the county governments. It has hints of a federal state like Ethiopia, Nigeria, Somalia and the United States where power has almost entirely been delegated to states. However, most elements point to the country being a unitary state with some degree of autonomy in the Counties of Kenya as is the case in a country such as France. Kenya is therefore a unitary state with a decentralised system as per the new Constitution of Kenya 2010. It is essential that decentralisation/semi-autonomy not be confused with federalism as they aren't exactly similar concepts. Spain has autonomous communities yet it isn't exactly considered a federal state like Germany or Ethiopia.
Originally the central government delegated power through devolution since gaining independence from the United Kingdom in 1963 until the country held a referendum in 2010 to amend the Constitution, among which amendments was the devolving of certain powers and duties of the national government to the semi-autonomous governments of the newly-created counties.
The country was initially led by a Prime Minister, but upon the country becoming a full republic in 1964, the Prime Minister's title was changed to President of Kenya.
The current structure of government allows power to be held on two levels: The national level and the county level.
The country is a representative democracy legislatively, and a direct democracy in the election of its president, who is leader of the Executive branch of government.
The Legislative branch is known as the Parliament of Kenya, and is established under Chapter Eight of the Constitution. It is bicameral, comprising the National Assembly and the Senate. The Legislature is primarily mandated with legislation within the country and is organised as follows:
The National Assembly is made up of 349 elected members (known as Member of Parliament or MP), consisting of 290 members elected from constituencies within the counties, 47 women elected at county-level, 12 nominated representatives and the Speaker, who is an ex-officio member. Each of the 290 members represents the constituency from where they were elected. The members of Parliament serve five-year terms..
In order to be elected as a member of the National Assembly, an individual must be registered as a voter, satisfies any requirements prescribed by the Constitution or by an act of Parliament and is nominated by a political party, or is an independent candidate.
All members are elected or nominated, including the Speaker, who is elected from persons qualified to be elected as members of Parliament but are not members.
In contrast, the Senate is made up of 47 Senators representing each of the 47 counties, 16 women nominated by political parties according to the parties' proportions in the Senate, one man and woman to represent the youth, one man and women to represent persons with disabilities, and the Speaker, who is also an ex-officio member like the National Assembly's Speaker.
The National Assembly and Senate each have particular powers. The National Assembly mainly deals with legislation affecting the country at the national level as well as exercising oversight over the national government while the Senate mainly deals with legislation concerning counties as well as exercising oversight over the county governments. However, both Houses' approval is required in any matter so determined by an act of Parliament, such as presidential appointments to the Executive and Judiciary, military officers and ambassadors.","What would be the likely impact on the electoral landscape of Kenya if a presidential candidate, who has never held public office before, was able to secure the nomination of a major political party?

Note: The question does not mention the nomination process, but requires knowledge of the subtopic and the given context to answer.","The likely impact on the electoral landscape of Kenya if a presidential candidate, who has never held public office before, was able to secure the nomination of a major political party would be significant.

This could lead to a difficult campaign for the candidate, as they would need to work to establish their credibility and build trust with voters.","['https://dk.usembassy.gov/usa-i-skolen/presidential-elections-and-the-american-political-system/', 'https://www.accc.gov.au/system/files/ACCC+commissioned+report+-+The+impact+of+digital+platforms+on+news+and+journalistic+content,+Centre+for+Media+Transition+(2).pdf', 'https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0760/12/9/469', 'https://dk.usembassy.gov/usa-i-skolen/presidential-elections-and-the-american-political-system/', 'https://www.accc.gov.au/system/files/ACCC+commissioned+report+-+The+impact+of+digital+platforms+on+news+and+journalistic+content,+Centre+for+Media+Transition+(2).pdf', 'https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0760/12/9/469', 'https://dk.usembassy.gov/usa-i-skolen/presidential-elections-and-the-american-political-system/', 'https://www.accc.gov.au/system/files/ACCC+commissioned+report+-+The+impact+of+digital+platforms+on+news+and+journalistic+content,+Centre+for+Media+Transition+(2).pdf', 'https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0760/12/9/469', 'https://dk.usembassy.gov/usa-i-skolen/presidential-elections-and-the-american-political-system/', 'https://www.accc.gov.au/system/files/ACCC+commissioned+report+-+The+impact+of+digital+platforms+on+news+and+journalistic+content,+Centre+for+Media+Transition+(2).pdf', 'https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0760/12/9/469', 'https://dk.usembassy.gov/usa-i-skolen/presidential-elections-and-the-american-political-system/', 'https://www.accc.gov.au/system/files/ACCC+commissioned+report+-+The+impact+of+digital+platforms+on+news+and+journalistic+content,+Centre+for+Media+Transition+(2).pdf', 'https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0760/12/9/469']",politics

The Government of the Republic of Kenya (GoK) is the national government of the Republic of Kenya, a federal republic located in East Africa, composed of 47 Counties, each county with its own semi-autonomous governments, including the national capital of Nairobi, where the national government is primarily based.
The national government is composed of three distinct branches: The Legislature (Parliament), the Executive and the Judiciary. Each arm is independent of the other and their individual roles are set by the Constitution of Kenya while their powers and duties are further defined by acts of Parliament.
The full name of the country is the ""Republic of Kenya"". Its official Swahili name is ""Jamhuri ya Kenya"". No other names appear in the Constitution, and these are the names that appear on the country's currency, in treaties, and in legal cases to which the nation is a party.
Other terms such as ""GoK"", ""GK"" and ""Serikali"" are often used officially and informally to distinguish the national government from the county governments.
The Government's structure consists of power shared between the national government and the county governments. It has hints of a federal state like Ethiopia, Nigeria, Somalia and the United States where power has almost entirely been delegated to states. However, most elements point to the country being a unitary state with some degree of autonomy in the Counties of Kenya as is the case in a country such as France. Kenya is therefore a unitary state with a decentralised system as per the new Constitution of Kenya 2010. It is essential that decentralisation/semi-autonomy not be confused with federalism as they aren't exactly similar concepts. Spain has autonomous communities yet it isn't exactly considered a federal state like Germany or Ethiopia.
Originally the central government delegated power through devolution since gaining independence from the United Kingdom in 1963 until the country held a referendum in 2010 to amend the Constitution, among which amendments was the devolving of certain powers and duties of the national government to the semi-autonomous governments of the newly-created counties.
The country was initially led by a Prime Minister, but upon the country becoming a full republic in 1964, the Prime Minister's title was changed to President of Kenya.
The current structure of government allows power to be held on two levels: The national level and the county level.
The country is a representative democracy legislatively, and a direct democracy in the election of its president, who is leader of the Executive branch of government.
The Legislative branch is known as the Parliament of Kenya, and is established under Chapter Eight of the Constitution. It is bicameral, comprising the National Assembly and the Senate. The Legislature is primarily mandated with legislation within the country and is organised as follows:
The National Assembly is made up of 349 elected members (known as Member of Parliament or MP), consisting of 290 members elected from constituencies within the counties, 47 women elected at county-level, 12 nominated representatives and the Speaker, who is an ex-officio member. Each of the 290 members represents the constituency from where they were elected. The members of Parliament serve five-year terms..
In order to be elected as a member of the National Assembly, an individual must be registered as a voter, satisfies any requirements prescribed by the Constitution or by an act of Parliament and is nominated by a political party, or is an independent candidate.
All members are elected or nominated, including the Speaker, who is elected from persons qualified to be elected as members of Parliament but are not members.
In contrast, the Senate is made up of 47 Senators representing each of the 47 counties, 16 women nominated by political parties according to the parties' proportions in the Senate, one man and woman to represent the youth, one man and women to represent persons with disabilities, and the Speaker, who is also an ex-officio member like the National Assembly's Speaker.
The National Assembly and Senate each have particular powers. The National Assembly mainly deals with legislation affecting the country at the national level as well as exercising oversight over the national government while the Senate mainly deals with legislation concerning counties as well as exercising oversight over the county governments. However, both Houses' approval is required in any matter so determined by an act of Parliament, such as presidential appointments to the Executive and Judiciary, military officers and ambassadors.","What is the typical duration of a parliamentary session in Kenya, and how does this impact the country's ability to respond to emerging national crises?

(Note: This question requires understanding of the legislative process in Kenya, including the composition of the National Assembly and the process of bill passage.)","The typical duration of a parliamentary session in Kenya varies, with odd-numbered years having a longer session than even-numbered years.

This concept is closely tied to the idea of representation, as it implies that the government is accountable to the people and exists to serve their interests. The Constitution establishes a system of representation, where citizens elect representatives to the House of Representatives and the Senate, and the President is elected through the Electoral College. This system ensures that the government is accountable to the people and that their voices are heard. The concept of ""We the People"" also implies that the government has a duty to protect and serve the people, and that the people have a right to participate in the democratic process.","['https://constitutioncenter.org/the-constitution/preamble', 'https://www.uscourts.gov/about-federal-courts/educational-resources/about-educational-outreach/activity-resources/us', 'https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/preamble/', 'https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/', 'https://www.senate.gov/about/origins-foundations/senate-and-constitution/equal-state-representation.htm', 'https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/amdt14-S2-1/ALDE_00000847/']",politics

The Anti-Federalist movement influenced the drafting of the Constitution by prompting the addition of the Bill of Rights, which was designed to address the concerns of the Anti-Federalists and protect individual liberties and states' rights.","['https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/creating-the-united-states/formation-of-political-parties.html', 'https://firstamendment.mtsu.edu/article/anti-federalists/', 'https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/more-perfect-union', 'https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/the-anti-federalists-and-their-important-role-during-the-ratification-fight', 'https://firstamendment.mtsu.edu/article/anti-federalists/', 'https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/more-perfect-union']",politics

"Remembering Benazir Bhutto
What were murdered political leader Benazir Bhutto’s views on Pakistan?
December 27, 2007
Back in 1988, Benazir Bhutto made history by becoming Pakistan’s prime minister — making her the first woman leader of a Muslim country in modern times. After an eight-year voluntary exile, the leader of Pakistan’s popular opposition party returned to the country in mid-October 2007 — and was assassinated on December 27. We present Ms. Bhutto’s views on the future of Pakistan, a country on the faultline of major global challenges.
Why did you reengage in your country’s politics?
“There are moments in history that prove decisive and mark a turning point for the future. The U.S. Civil War was such a moment in the United States. The fall of the Berlin Wall was such a moment for Germany and the European Union. Today is Pakistan’s moment of truth.”
Why does Pakistan matter so much in a global context?
“We confront two great polarities in Pakistan today — the battle between democracy and dictatorship, and the fight for the hearts and souls of the people manifest in the battle between moderation and extremism.”
How concerned are you that extremists will take over Pakistan?
“Mr. Musharraf’s dictatorship is fueling instability in Pakistan. Oppressed citizens, who are denied a truly representative government that can address their most basic issues, now seek refuge in extremism and religion fundamentalism.”
Is Musharraf at the root of Pakistan’s problem?
“General Musharraf is sincere, but there are some vested interests who do not want to see a peaceful transition from military rule to democracy.”
Was a political crisis in the offing?
“It is up to the government to decide whether it wants a peaceful transition to democracy through free and fair elections — or face people’s power and a Ukrainian-style Orange Revolution in Pakistan.”
So what’s the way out?
“Unless the people of Pakistan are empowered through the ballot, extremists will continue to exploit the discontent to their advantage.”
How important is democracy in all this?
“The restoration of democracy is only the first step. I would like to see the international community make a long-term commitment to a country as critical as Pakistan — and indeed our nearby neighbor, Afghanistan, in helping us to build our institutions.”
Are there parallels to Europe — and how it was supported for several decades in the 20th century?
“When Europe was driven by war, the international community put NATO troops into Europe — and it made a long-term commitment through the Marshall Plan to develop the institutions.”
Won’t the buoyant Pakistani economy support these efforts?
“On paper, the economic statistics look good because you’ve got the external flows coming in. But in fact, poverty and unemployment in Pakistan has risen, and it’s ticking like a time bomb.”
What is unique about your political journey?
“I have led an unusual life. I have buried a father killed at age 50 and two brothers killed in the prime of their lives. I raised my children as a single mother when my husband was arrested and held for eight years without a conviction — a hostage to my political career. I made my choice when the mantle of political leadership was thrust upon my shoulders after my father’s murder. I did not shrink from responsibility then, and I will not shrink from it now.”
And finally, what would you have done differently from the last time you held office?
“The people wanted me to be there as a woman leader, somebody who was more nurturing, who could take care of our people, our women, our children, redress their needs, build them hostels and schools and provide them with basic nutrition. I wish I had focused more on that than on the more militaristic notions.”","How might the lack of representation of women in Pakistani politics contribute to the country's struggle to address the needs of its most vulnerable populations, such as those affected by poverty and extremism?","The lack of representation of women in Pakistani politics can have significant consequences for the country's most vulnerable populations, including those affected by poverty and extremism. The absence of women in government can lead to higher corruption rates, which can exacerbate poverty and inequality. Additionally, the low participation of women in the labor force can perpetuate poverty and limit economic opportunities.","['https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03068374.2020.1748414', 'https://ballardbrief.byu.edu/issue-briefs/lack-of-women-in-government-in-the-mena-region', 'https://thediplomat.com/2023/05/where-are-the-women-in-pakistans-politics/', 'https://press.un.org/en/2023/sc15222.doc.htm', 'https://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/economic-empowerment/facts-and-figures', 'https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Events/WHRD/WomenRightsAreHR.pdf', 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03068374.2020.1748414', 'https://ballardbrief.byu.edu/issue-briefs/lack-of-women-in-government-in-the-mena-region', 'https://irl.umsl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1840&context=dissertation', 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03068374.2020.1748414', 'https://ballardbrief.byu.edu/issue-briefs/lack-of-women-in-government-in-the-mena-region', 'https://irl.umsl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1840&context=dissertation']",politics

These factors can be applied to address the current economic challenges faced by the country by focusing on diversifying the economy, promoting social cohesion, and balancing debt sustainability and financial resilience.

Pakistan's experience suggests that this phenomenon is not unique to any one country, but rather a global trend that can be attributed to a combination of factors, including economic inequality, political instability, and a sense of disconnection from institutions.","['https://www.state.gov/reports/country-reports-on-terrorism-2019/', 'https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/monographs/2004/RAND_MG246.pdf', 'https://www.populismstudies.org/imran-khan-from-cricket-batsman-to-populist-captain-tabdeli-of-pakistan/', 'https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2018/05/10/blog-trust-and-the-future-of-multilateralism', 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09644016.2021.1978200', 'https://spssi.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/asap.12378', 'https://www.populismstudies.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ECPS-Party-Profile-Series-3.pdf', 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/joac.12526', 'https://asiasociety.org/education/pakistan-political-history', 'https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/GlobalTrends_2040.pdf', 'https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/populisms-threat-to-democracy-comparative-lessons-for-the-united-states/BF94B9ED2AE558EBCC8682CF4DC08F7A', 'https://newleftreview.org/issues/i74/articles/hamza-alavi-the-state-in-post-colonial-societies-pakistan-and-bangladesh']",politics

"No matter where we are in the world, we change the dynamics of power when we use the Internet for political ends. Take a familiar case: the way community organizers used new technologies in Barack Obama’s 2008 election bid, which helped his cause and established a benchmark for other campaigns. In Kenya, the fact that bloggers are reporting publicly on debates in parliament for all the world to see gives politicians reason for pause before they speak and take action. In Switzerland and other advanced democracies, new technologies establish an important space for experimentation in public decision making. Each of these is a good thing.
We know, too, that the Internet is used as effectively by states as it is by activists, though often not in the interest of democratization. The Turkish government alters the political discourse when its censors tell the country’s Internet service providers to block all access to YouTube–which is widely popular there, as it is in the United States–because a video critical of Atatürk, the country’s modern founding father, popped up somewhere on the site.
The power of the Net is not lost on dictators or military juntas. The Internet is an extraordinary way to snoop on conversations and to look at documents sitting on hard drives in virtually every connected state in the world–as the recent exposure of a vast online spy network, centered in China, made plain.
It is not altogether clear, from the data we have, whether the Internet is a boon to the spread of democracy or its bane. The answer depends greatly on whether you are asking the question from an advanced democracy, from a state in transition, or from a country firmly under authoritarian control.
From the perch of a stable, prosperous state, the Internet is mostly a constructive force. True, we have hard problems to tackle, like how much surveillance we are willing to live with in the name of law enforcement and national security. And we ought to focus on ensuring that our kids, growing up in a digital era, are encouraged to use the Internet in safe, creative ways. But by and large, the Internet provides opportunities to improve our democracies and our economies.
In less democratic societies, sophisticated use of the Internet is limited to the few and the elite. Too often, using these tools puts activists at risk of greater control by the state, through surveillance, censorship, and imprisonment. Political leaders in dozens of states around the world are using digital tools to extend the reach of their power through propaganda, fear, and self-censorship. Resistance is limited to an impassioned, but widely dispersed, community of Internet activists. Bottom-up resistance plainly works at the margins: the tech-savvy can elude most censorship and surveillance most of the time (see “Dissent Made Safer,” p. 60). But so too can the smartest of tyrants keep the bulk of their citizens under greater, not lesser, control.

"No matter where we are in the world, we change the dynamics of power when we use the Internet for political ends. Take a familiar case: the way community organizers used new technologies in Barack Obama’s 2008 election bid, which helped his cause and established a benchmark for other campaigns.

"This issue of Insight Turkey comes with a different format and brings to its readers two different topics that require special attention when we consider the latest regional and global affairs. The planned topic was Central Asia; however, the early presidential and parliamentarian elections in Turkey led us to cover a second topic in the issue. First, the current issue focuses on a forgotten but very important region of Central Asia. The second section of the journal comprises commentaries and articles on the latest elections in Turkey, how to understand them and what could be the future of the presidential system.
Central Asia is one of the most geostrategic and penetrated regions in the world. The founding father of geopolitics, the British geographer Sir Halford John Mackinder, considers Central Asia as a part of the “heartland.” The control of Central Asia, a region stretching from the Caspian Sea in the west to China in the east, is a precondition of the world hegemony. Throughout the 20thcentury, the Central Asian countries were under the rule of the Soviet Union. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the republics of Central Asia re-emerged as independent actors of international politics. Later, they were declared as “near abroad” by Russia; that is, they were kept close to Russia through several multilateral platforms.
Nowadays, Central Asian countries, namely Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan, face many challenges such as underdevelopment, poor governance and corruption, mutual mistrust between neighbors, fear of radicalism, and threats from neighboring global powers. The governments of the regional countries must work together in order to be able to overcome these challenges. They need to increase intra-regional trade and to de-securitize their relations with other countries.
Central Asian countries are squeezed between two heavyweight powers, Russia and China. With the revitalization of the historical Silk Road by China, many observers began to discuss the increasing importance and role of the Central Asian countries. Central Asia will be the main ground for intra-East regional and global competition. The mostly Turkic and Muslim countries can play the role of game changers at least, between the two global actors.
Turkey, a country which shares the same language, history and culture with the Central Asian countries, is also one of the effective actors in the region. After an unprepared and unsuccessful attempt to forge links, in the wake of their independence in the 1990s, Turkey has improved its relations with the Turkic states and now has multi-dimensional relations (economic, cultural, political, and security) with these countries.
The transformation of the Turkish political system into a presidential one, after the April 16, 2017 referendum, was finalized with the June 24, 2018 elections, when Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was elected as the first Turkish president in the context of the new presidential system. Naturally, many questions have risen in terms of the transformation of the new system and its impact on Turkey’s foreign policy. This issue of Insight Turkey aims to discuss this political transformation.
Turkey has been governed by a multi-party parliamentarian system for decades. The country has experienced several chaotic periods due to political instabilities, mainly as a result of coalition or weak governments. Since Turkey could not end the bureaucratic (especially military and judiciary) tutelage, it could not consolidate its democracy under the parliamentarian system. Therefore, many politicians such as Necmettin Erbakan and Süleyman Demirel asked for the transformation of the system into a presidential one. At a time when the whole world has been experiencing a transformation, Turkey has also decided to consolidate its political authority; and therefore, it has decided to transform its political system into a unified and strong executive power in order to be able to struggle against emerging threats. Ultimately, as a regional power and global actor, Turkey now has a strong political leadership, who plays an effective role in international politics.
In this issue, we bring four manuscripts which analyze in detail the June 2018 elections and the new presidential system in Turkey.

The planned topic was Central Asia; however, the early presidential and parliamentarian elections in Turkey led us to cover a second topic in the issue. First, the current issue focuses on a forgotten but very important region of Central Asia. The second section of the journal comprises commentaries and articles on the latest elections in Turkey, how to understand them and what could be the future of the presidential system.
Central Asia is one of the most geostrategic and penetrated regions in the world. The founding father of geopolitics, the British geographer Sir Halford John Mackinder, considers Central Asia as a part of the “heartland.” The control of Central Asia, a region stretching from the Caspian Sea in the west to China in the east, is a precondition of the world hegemony. Throughout the 20thcentury, the Central Asian countries were under the rule of the Soviet Union. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the republics of Central Asia re-emerged as independent actors of international politics. Later, they were declared as “near abroad” by Russia; that is, they were kept close to Russia through several multilateral platforms.
Nowadays, Central Asian countries, namely Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan, face many challenges such as underdevelopment, poor governance and corruption, mutual mistrust between neighbors, fear of radicalism, and threats from neighboring global powers. The governments of the regional countries must work together in order to be able to overcome these challenges. They need to increase intra-regional trade and to de-securitize their relations with other countries.
Central Asian countries are squeezed between two heavyweight powers, Russia and China. With the revitalization of the historical Silk Road by China, many observers began to discuss the increasing importance and role of the Central Asian countries. Central Asia will be the main ground for intra-East regional and global competition. The mostly Turkic and Muslim countries can play the role of game changers at least, between the two global actors.
Turkey, a country which shares the same language, history and culture with the Central Asian countries, is also one of the effective actors in the region. After an unprepared and unsuccessful attempt to forge links, in the wake of their independence in the 1990s, Turkey has improved its relations with the Turkic states and now has multi-dimensional relations (economic, cultural, political, and security) with these countries.
The transformation of the Turkish political system into a presidential one, after the April 16, 2017 referendum, was finalized with the June 24, 2018 elections, when Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was elected as the first Turkish president in the context of the new presidential system. Naturally, many questions have risen in terms of the transformation of the new system and its impact on Turkey’s foreign policy. This issue of Insight Turkey aims to discuss this political transformation.
Turkey has been governed by a multi-party parliamentarian system for decades. The country has experienced several chaotic periods due to political instabilities, mainly as a result of coalition or weak governments. Since Turkey could not end the bureaucratic (especially military and judiciary) tutelage, it could not consolidate its democracy under the parliamentarian system. Therefore, many politicians such as Necmettin Erbakan and Süleyman Demirel asked for the transformation of the system into a presidential one. At a time when the whole world has been experiencing a transformation, Turkey has also decided to consolidate its political authority; and therefore, it has decided to transform its political system into a unified and strong executive power in order to be able to struggle against emerging threats. Ultimately, as a regional power and global actor, Turkey now has a strong political leadership, who plays an effective role in international politics.
In this issue, we bring four manuscripts which analyze in detail the June 2018 elections and the new presidential system in Turkey. On the verge of the reorganization process in Turkey, Zahid Sobacı, Özer Köseoğlu, and Nebi Miş in their article provide a legal and institutional analysis of how the public policy process and the roles and responsibilities of policy actors have changed with the new system.","How might the revitalization of the historical Silk Road impact the regional stability of Central Asia, considering the complex political and economic dynamics at play in the region?

When the 6-point and 11-point movements towards the end of Pakistan regime were at their height and at the beginning of Bangladesh, the representatives of Jumma people raised the problem of Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) to almost all political parties, personalities and leaders of left, middle and rightwing ideology. A very few political leaders considered the importance of the problem properly, and even many were indifferent to listen patiently to the problem. Bangladesh has become independent but there is no exception to the said situation. Manbendra Narayan Larma (M N Larma) raised the issues to various political parties of the country to solve the CHT problem. However, except some verbal sympathy, in reality no political party came forward to solve the problem and has not adopted the issue as its own political program. Rather, they contrarily offered M N Larma to join their political party.
It is noteworthy that the political programs of most of the national political parties of Bangladesh are permeated with ultra-nationalist and ultra-communal ideologies. Usually, these parties bear the views of imperialist, bureaucratic capitalist, feudalist and mercenary ideology. Therefore, the problems of ethnic and linguistic minorities and indigenous ethnic groups like the CHT problem are not given priority in their political program. The progressive political parties of Bangladesh provide support to solve the CHT problem as per CHT Accord of 1997, but they do not adopt the issue in their own political programs. In the harsh reality of the country’s political culture, the great leaders M N Larma and progressive forces of Jumma peoples felt the need for their own political party.
It goes without saying that on 16 December 1971, in exchange of many sacrifices of lives, losing honor of numerous mothers and sisters and the fresh blood of many people, East Pakistan became Bangladesh as an independent sovereign state. As the light of hope rose in the minds of Bengalis all over the country after independence, so also the light of hope was transmitted in the minds of Jumma peoples in CHT. The indigenous Jumma peoples hoped for an end to the ongoing racial exploitation and re-establishment of their rights in the state that had emerged through a bloody armed struggle against ethnic exploitation.
During the Pakistan regime, Jumma peoples were termed as pro-Indian. And as soon as Bangladesh was created, overnight the Jumma peoples started being labeled as pro-Pakistani. But the Jumma people also had a considerable contribution in the liberation struggle of Bangladesh. Despite this, the radical Bengali nationalist reactionary group continued to vilify the Jumma peoples as pro-Pakistani as part of a nefarious conspiracy to uproot them. With the emergence of Bangladesh, while the indescribable inhuman torture and oppression started on the one hand, the conspiracy to ethnic cleansing of Jumma people on the other hand. As soon as the wounds of the tyranny of the Pak army did not dry up, the people of Jumma fell into a state of unrest. Jummas were termed as ‘pro-Pakistani’ and subjected to murder, rape, arson, abduction, looting. In various parts of CHT, outsider Bengalis were invaded and encroached on the lands of the Jumma peoples. What the Pakistan government did not dare to do, the newly emerged independent Bangladesh government did not hesitate to do so.
The Constitution of Bangladesh, adopted in 1972 immediately after independence, completely negates the system of self-governance of the CHT that existed from pre-colonial times. Despite the repeated demands of the Jumma peoples, the Constitution of Bangladesh does not mention a single word about the self-governance system of the CHT and distinct entity of the Jumma peoples. Moreover, in Article 6 of the Constitution, the indigenous peoples living in the country including the Jumma people of the CHT were referred to as Bengalis by stating that ‘the citizens of Bangladesh shall be known as Bengalis’ which was a motto of extreme racism and ultra-communalism of the rulers of a country that had achieved independence by struggling against ethnic oppression. This resulted in extreme anger and discontent among the Jumma peoples. Jumma peoples became more terrified by this.",What are the long-term consequences of neglecting the implementation of the CHT Accord's provisions on law and order and security on the stability and development of the CHT region?,"The long-term consequences of neglecting the implementation of the CHT Accord's provisions on law and order and security on the stability and development of the CHT region are not explicitly mentioned in the search results.

The progressive political parties of Bangladesh provide support to solve the CHT problem as per CHT Accord of 1997, but they do not adopt the issue in their own political programs. In the harsh reality of the country’s political culture, the great leaders M N Larma and progressive forces of Jumma peoples felt the need for their own political party.
It goes without saying that on 16 December 1971, in exchange of many sacrifices of lives, losing honor of numerous mothers and sisters and the fresh blood of many people, East Pakistan became Bangladesh as an independent sovereign state. As the light of hope rose in the minds of Bengalis all over the country after independence, so also the light of hope was transmitted in the minds of Jumma peoples in CHT. The indigenous Jumma peoples hoped for an end to the ongoing racial exploitation and re-establishment of their rights in the state that had emerged through a bloody armed struggle against ethnic exploitation.
During the Pakistan regime, Jumma peoples were termed as pro-Indian. And as soon as Bangladesh was created, overnight the Jumma peoples started being labeled as pro-Pakistani. But the Jumma people also had a considerable contribution in the liberation struggle of Bangladesh. Despite this, the radical Bengali nationalist reactionary group continued to vilify the Jumma peoples as pro-Pakistani as part of a nefarious conspiracy to uproot them. With the emergence of Bangladesh, while the indescribable inhuman torture and oppression started on the one hand, the conspiracy to ethnic cleansing of Jumma people on the other hand. As soon as the wounds of the tyranny of the Pak army did not dry up, the people of Jumma fell into a state of unrest. Jummas were termed as ‘pro-Pakistani’ and subjected to murder, rape, arson, abduction, looting. In various parts of CHT, outsider Bengalis were invaded and encroached on the lands of the Jumma peoples. What the Pakistan government did not dare to do, the newly emerged independent Bangladesh government did not hesitate to do so.
The Constitution of Bangladesh, adopted in 1972 immediately after independence, completely negates the system of self-governance of the CHT that existed from pre-colonial times. Despite the repeated demands of the Jumma peoples, the Constitution of Bangladesh does not mention a single word about the self-governance system of the CHT and distinct entity of the Jumma peoples. Moreover, in Article 6 of the Constitution, the indigenous peoples living in the country including the Jumma people of the CHT were referred to as Bengalis by stating that ‘the citizens of Bangladesh shall be known as Bengalis’ which was a motto of extreme racism and ultra-communalism of the rulers of a country that had achieved independence by struggling against ethnic oppression. This resulted in extreme anger and discontent among the Jumma peoples. Jumma peoples became more terrified by this.","How do you think the historical experiences of indigenous communities around the world, such as the Maori in New Zealand or the Native Americans in the United States, could inform the development of a more inclusive and representative political system in Bangladesh, particularly in the context of the CHT?","The historical experiences of indigenous communities around the world, such as the Maori in New Zealand and the Native Americans in the United States, could inform the development of a more inclusive and representative political system in Bangladesh, particularly in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT), by highlighting the importance of respecting indigenous rights, promoting social integration, and creating a more just and equitable society.","['https://www.amnesty.org/en/what-we-do/indigenous-peoples/', 'https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/indigenouspeoples', 'https://nhm.org/stories/beyond-gender-indigenous-perspectives-faafafine-and-faafatama', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LXtnnruB30', 'https://web.colby.edu/offmayflowerhill/2019/09/26/learning-from-maori-culture/', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-cZgT-F3U', 'https://iwgia.org/en/cht', 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37525224/', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10567977/', 'https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/egms/docs/2009/Ghana/inclusive-society.pdf', 'https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/report/2022/The-Sustainable-Development-Goals-Report-2022.pdf', 'https://www.state.gov/reports/2023-trafficking-in-persons-report/']",politics

When the 6-point and 11-point movements towards the end of Pakistan regime were at their height and at the beginning of Bangladesh, the representatives of Jumma people raised the problem of Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) to almost all political parties, personalities and leaders of left, middle and rightwing ideology. A very few political leaders considered the importance of the problem properly, and even many were indifferent to listen patiently to the problem. Bangladesh has become independent but there is no exception to the said situation. Manbendra Narayan Larma (M N Larma) raised the issues to various political parties of the country to solve the CHT problem. However, except some verbal sympathy, in reality no political party came forward to solve the problem and has not adopted the issue as its own political program. Rather, they contrarily offered M N Larma to join their political party.

Note: The question does not explicitly mention feudalism, manorialism, or agricultural innovation, but requires knowledge of the impact of feudalism on these topics to answer correctly.","The impact of feudalism's emphasis on local self-sufficiency and limited trade on global food systems and international trade agreements in the modern era is that it has shaped the way we produce, distribute, and consume food today. The feudal system's focus on local self-sufficiency led to the development of regional food systems, which were often isolated from global trade networks. This isolationism limited the exchange of goods, services, and ideas, and hindered the development of global food systems.

The limited trade during the feudal era also led to the development of regional trade agreements and membership in multinational economic organizations, which significantly impacted international trade. The modern era has seen the rise of global trade agreements, such as the World Trade Organization (WTO), which has further integrated global food systems.

In conclusion, the impact of feudalism's emphasis on local self-sufficiency and limited trade on global food systems and international trade agreements in the modern era is that it has shaped the way we produce, distribute, and consume food today, and has led to the development of regional and global trade agreements.","['https://education.ohio.gov/getattachment/Topics/Learning-in-Ohio/Social-Studies/Ohio-s-Learning-Standards-for-Social-Studies/SSFinalStandards01019.pdf.aspx?lang=en-US', 'https://academic.oup.com/heapol/article/33/1/123/4587590', 'https://www.iss.nl/sites/corporate/files/CMCP_1-_Bernstein.pdf', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9561052/', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture_in_the_Middle_Ages', 'https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sarela-herrada-58665643_the-juggle-is-real-how-simplis-sarela-herrada-activity-7183556181007699969-nhL1', 'https://education.ohio.gov/getattachment/Topics/Learning-in-Ohio/Social-Studies/Ohio-s-Learning-Standards-for-Social-Studies/SSFinalStandards01019.pdf.aspx?lang=en-US', 'https://www.iss.nl/sites/corporate/files/CMCP_1-_Bernstein.pdf', 'https://www.fldoe.org/core/fileparse.php/20653/urlt/6-4.pdf', 'https://education.ohio.gov/getattachment/Topics/Learning-in-Ohio/Social-Studies/Ohio-s-Learning-Standards-for-Social-Studies/SSFinalStandards01019.pdf.aspx?lang=en-US', 'https://www.iss.nl/sites/corporate/files/CMCP_1-_Bernstein.pdf', 'https://www.fldoe.org/core/fileparse.php/20653/urlt/6-4.pdf', 'https://education.ohio.gov/getattachment/Topics/Learning-in-Ohio/Social-Studies/Ohio-s-Learning-Standards-for-Social-Studies/SSFinalStandards01019.pdf.aspx?lang=en-US', 'https://www.iss.nl/sites/corporate/files/CMCP_1-_Bernstein.pdf', 'https://www.fldoe.org/core/fileparse.php/20653/urlt/6-4.pdf', 'https://education.ohio.gov/getattachment/Topics/Learning-in-Ohio/Social-Studies/Ohio-s-Learning-Standards-for-Social-Studies/SSFinalStandards01019.pdf.aspx?lang=en-US', 'https://www.iss.nl/sites/corporate/files/CMCP_1-_Bernstein.pdf', 'https://www.fldoe.org/core/fileparse.php/20653/urlt/6-4.pdf']",politics
