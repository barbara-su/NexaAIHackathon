"and entrepreneurship education can equip them with the skills to navigate the complex economic landscape and pursue innovative solutions to social and environmental challenges.
Education systems can create a deeper awareness of sustainability, environmental stewardship, and cultural diversity by including indigenous perspectives, traditional ecological knowledge, and cultural heritage in the curriculum. However, traditional cultures often resist modern educational techniques and should be progressively transformed to embrace more innovative approaches. This necessitates interacting with communities, respecting their beliefs, and co-creating educational programmes that bridge the gap between traditional knowledge and modern abilities. Balancing cultural preservation with the learning of contemporary skills is critical for equipping young people to flourish in a fast-changing society.

Early childhood education sets the foundation for future learning and development. Governments should invest in quality early childhood programmes prioritising play-based learning, cognitive development, and social-emotional skills. Primary and secondary education should cultivate critical thinking, creativity, problem-solving, and digital literacy. Assessments should go beyond rote memorisation and standardised testing, encompassing real-world applications and project-based learning. Strategies for educating different age groups must be tailored accordingly, with younger children requiring more playful elements in their education. Furthermore, education systems should be assessed based on the skills possessed by young people. International assessments like the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study

"The challenges facing young people today are unprecedented. From lost educational opportunities due to the pandemic-induced lockdowns to the looming climate crisis, dangerous virtual spaces, and concerns over food and energy security triggered by geopolitical conflicts—the hurdles they face are numerous, complex, and interconnected. However, young people worldwide are rising to these challenges, coalescing around issues, and creating innovative solutions that consider diverse cultures, geographies, and development statuses. The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4 on Quality Education, recognises the pivotal role that education plays in achieving comprehensive development in the longer horizon. It aims
to ‘ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all’, especially for the youth to thrive in the modern world.

|SDG 4 Scores (out of 100)
|Eastern Europe and Central Asia
|East and South Asia
|Latin America and the Caribbean
|Middle East and North Africa
|Small Island Developing States
Note: The 2023 SDG 4 scores are based on the following indicators:
1. Participation rate in pre-primary organised learning (% of children aged 4 to 6)
2. Net primary enrollment rate (%)
3. Lower secondary completion rate (%)
4. Literacy rate (% of the population aged 15 to 24)
5. Tertiary educational attainment (% of the population aged 25 to 34)
6. PISA score (worst 0-600 best)
7. Variation in science performance explained by socio-economic status (%)
8. Underachievers in science (% of 15-year-olds)
The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted education systems globally, leading to lost school years and increasing educational inequality. It has exacerbated the divide between the Global North and South. As restrictions became widespread, schools had to close, impacting the achievement of SDG 4 targets. However, certain countries could reopen schools earlier due to better health infrastructure and advanced educational facilities. For instance
, children in advanced economies lost an average of 15 school days in 2020. In contrast, the number increased to an average of 45 days for emerging-market economies and a staggering 72 days for children in the poorest nations. Bridging these disparities in educational losses between developed and developing countries has become crucial in the post-pandemic recovery processes, as it determines the long-term macroeconomic structure of the global economies, with youth capital playing a pivotal role.
Technology is a powerful tool for improving human capital building
and addressing structural issues in education needed for achieving equitable quality education. It has the potential to democratise knowledge access, making education more accessible and inclusive, particularly in resource-constrained countries. The growing use of educational technology (ed-tech) platforms has played a critical role in helping young people to complete their studies during the pandemic through remote learning, interactive material, and individualised learning experiences. Thanks to open educational resources (OERs), online courses, and digital libraries, learners can access educational materials at their own pace and convenience—which was extremely helpful during the pandemic.
Nevertheless, technology alone is insufficient
. The human element is crucial in delivering localised and contextualised education. While ed-tech platforms provide access to educational content, they should be complemented with effective pedagogical strategies and teacher support. Blended learning (combining online and in-person instructions) can accelerate learning and increase accessibility, particularly in developing countries where infrastructure limitations may persist.
also plays a vital role in fostering collaboration, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills. Thus, education systems can foster a sense of community and promote social cohesion by creating opportunities for young people to work together, share knowledge, and learn from one another. Moreover, policy-making in education reform must be guided by feminist principles of inclusivity, considering dimensions such as global citizenship, finance, and the environment. Financial literacy
and entrepreneurship education can equip them with the skills to navigate the complex economic landscape and pursue innovative solutions to social and environmental challenges.","Can AI-powered adaptive learning systems enhance the learning outcomes of students in under-resourced schools, and what are the potential challenges and limitations of implementing such systems in these contexts?","The potential of AI-powered adaptive learning systems to enhance learning outcomes in under-resourced schools is an intriguing topic, and it's essential to consider multiple perspectives and challenges.

"The challenges facing young people today are unprecedented. From lost educational opportunities due to the pandemic-induced lockdowns to the looming climate crisis, dangerous virtual spaces, and concerns over food and energy security triggered by geopolitical conflicts—the hurdles they face are numerous, complex, and interconnected. However, young people worldwide are rising to these challenges, coalescing around issues, and creating innovative solutions that consider diverse cultures, geographies, and development statuses. The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4 on Quality Education, recognises the pivotal role that education plays in achieving comprehensive development in the longer horizon. It aims
to ‘ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all’, especially for the youth to thrive in the modern world.
Table 1: SDG 4 Scores (2023)
Source: Sustainable Development Report 2023, SDSN
Reimagining tech in education
|SDG 4 Scores (out of 100)
|Eastern Europe and Central Asia
|East and South Asia
|Latin America and the Caribbean
|Middle East and North Africa
|Small Island Developing States
Note: The 2023 SDG 4 scores are based on the following indicators:
1. Participation rate in pre-primary organised learning (% of children aged 4 to 6)
2. Net primary enrollment rate (%)
3. Lower secondary completion rate (%)
4. Literacy rate (% of the population aged 15 to 24)
5. Tertiary educational attainment (% of the population aged 25 to 34)
6. PISA score (worst 0-600 best)
7. Variation in science performance explained by socio-economic status (%)
8. Underachievers in science (% of 15-year-olds)
The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted education systems globally, leading to lost school years and increasing educational inequality. It has exacerbated the divide between the Global North and South. As restrictions became widespread, schools had to close, impacting the achievement of SDG 4 targets. However, certain countries could reopen schools earlier due to better health infrastructure and advanced educational facilities. For instance
, children in advanced economies lost an average of 15 school days in 2020. In contrast, the number increased to an average of 45 days for emerging-market economies and a staggering 72 days for children in the poorest nations. Bridging these disparities in educational losses between developed and developing countries has become crucial in the post-pandemic recovery processes, as it determines the long-term macroeconomic structure of the global economies, with youth capital playing a pivotal role.
Technology is a powerful tool for improving human capital building
and addressing structural issues in education needed for achieving equitable quality education. It has the potential to democratise knowledge access, making education more accessible and inclusive, particularly in resource-constrained countries. The growing use of educational technology (ed-tech) platforms has played a critical role in helping young people to complete their studies during the pandemic through remote learning, interactive material, and individualised learning experiences. Thanks to open educational resources (OERs), online courses, and digital libraries, learners can access educational materials at their own pace and convenience—which was extremely helpful during the pandemic.
Nevertheless, technology alone is insufficient
. The human element is crucial in delivering localised and contextualised education. While ed-tech platforms provide access to educational content, they should be complemented with effective pedagogical strategies and teacher support. Blended learning (combining online and in-person instructions) can accelerate learning and increase accessibility, particularly in developing countries where infrastructure limitations may persist.
also plays a vital role in fostering collaboration, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills. Thus, education systems can foster a sense of community and promote social cohesion by creating opportunities for young people to work together, share knowledge, and learn from one another. Moreover, policy-making in education reform must be guided by feminist principles of inclusivity, considering dimensions such as global citizenship, finance, and the environment. Financial literacy
and entrepreneurship education can equip them with the skills to navigate the complex economic landscape and pursue innovative solutions to social and environmental challenges.","How can policymakers balance the need for fiscal sustainability with the imperative to provide education and training programs that equip young people with the skills to navigate the complex global economy, while also promoting sustainable development and social cohesion?",Policymakers can balance the need for fiscal sustainability with the imperative to provide education and training programs by adopting a multi-faceted approach that considers various perspectives.,"['https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/FM/Issues/2016/12/31/Balancing-Fiscal-Policy-Risks', 'https://igpa.uillinois.edu/', 'https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/exrp/macropol/eng/', 'https://ospi.k12.wa.us/policy-funding', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7734391/', 'https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/school-discipline/guiding-principles.pdf', 'https://www.cbpp.org/research/the-federal-job-guarantee-a-policy-to-achieve-permanent-full-employment', 'https://nationalskillscoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Integrated-Education-and-Training-Policy-Toolkit-1.pdf', 'https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R40213', 'https://www.oecd.org/en/about/directorates/directorate-for-education-and-skills.html', 'https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/exrp/macropol/eng/', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7734391/', 'https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fandd/issues/Series/Back-to-Basics/Fiscal-Policy', 'https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/school-discipline/guiding-principles.pdf', 'https://igpa.uillinois.edu/', 'https://www.cbpp.org/research/the-federal-job-guarantee-a-policy-to-achieve-permanent-full-employment', 'https://ospi.k12.wa.us/policy-funding', 'https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/reports/2023/12/pandemic-aid-how-states-safeguarded-against-future-budget-challenges', 'https://soeonline.american.edu/blog/5-ways-policy-makers-can-improve-the-quality-of-education/', 'https://www.americanprogress.org/article/how-to-ease-the-nursing-shortage-in-america/', 'https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/exrp/macropol/eng/', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7734391/', 'https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fandd/issues/Series/Back-to-Basics/Fiscal-Policy', 'https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/school-discipline/guiding-principles.pdf', 'https://igpa.uillinois.edu/', 'https://www.cbpp.org/research/the-federal-job-guarantee-a-policy-to-achieve-permanent-full-employment', 'https://ospi.k12.wa.us/policy-funding', 'https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/reports/2023/12/pandemic-aid-how-states-safeguarded-against-future-budget-challenges', 'https://soeonline.american.edu/blog/5-ways-policy-makers-can-improve-the-quality-of-education/', 'https://www.americanprogress.org/article/how-to-ease-the-nursing-shortage-in-america/']",education

Navigating the Educational Seas: The Marvels and Challenges of Technology
The Rise of Digital Classrooms
Gone are the days of chalkboards and dusty erasers. The advent of technology has ushered in a new era of digital classrooms. Smartboards have replaced traditional blackboards, transforming lessons into interactive experiences. With a tap and a swipe, teachers can bring lessons to life, integrating multimedia elements to engage students in ways unimaginable a few decades ago.
Digital textbooks have also found their place on the educational stage. No more heavy backpacks laden with thick volumes; now, students can carry entire libraries in the palm of their hands. E-books provide convenience and accessibility, allowing learners to explore a vast array of subjects with just a few clicks.
Access to Information and Online Learning
The internet, a colossal repository of knowledge, has become the cornerstone of modern education. Students no longer need to rely solely on textbooks and encyclopedias; a world of information is just a search away. Online platforms offer a plethora of educational resources, from video tutorials to interactive simulations, enriching the learning experience.
The rise of online learning has democratized education, breaking down geographical barriers. Students from different corners of the globe can now connect with top-notch educators and institutions through virtual classrooms. This has opened up educational opportunities for those who might not have access to traditional brick-and-mortar schools.
Personalized Learning Paths
One of the remarkable impacts of technology on education is the ability to tailor learning experiences to individual needs. Adaptive learning software analyzes students' strengths and weaknesses, providing personalized lessons that cater to their unique learning styles. This not only enhances understanding but also fosters a more inclusive educational environment.
Educational apps and games further contribute to personalized learning. These interactive tools make education enjoyable, turning lessons into engaging activities. From mathematics to language acquisition, students can reinforce their skills while having fun, blurring the lines between study and play.
Challenges on the Horizon
Despite the wonders technology has brought to education, it also raises challenges that educators and policymakers must grapple with. The digital divide, the gap between those who have access to technology and those who don't, remains a significant issue. Inequitable distribution of resources may leave some students behind, widening existing disparities in educational outcomes.
Another concern is the potential for technology to replace human interaction. While digital communication has its merits, the importance of face-to-face interaction in the learning process should not be underestimated. Building social skills, empathy, and teamwork are crucial aspects of education that must not be overshadowed by the allure of screens.
Preparing Students for the Future
As we sail further into the digital age, it becomes increasingly important to equip students with the skills they need to navigate the complexities of the future. Technological literacy is no longer a luxury but a necessity. Schools must integrate coding, digital literacy, and critical thinking skills into their curricula to prepare students for a rapidly evolving job market.
Additionally, fostering creativity and adaptability is key. The jobs of tomorrow may not even exist today, and students need to be adept at learning new skills throughout their lives. Technology can play a role in cultivating these qualities, providing tools for creative expression and problem-solving.
Cultivating Lifelong Learning Habits
Technology has given rise to a culture of continuous learning, encouraging individuals to engage in lifelong education. Online platforms offer a plethora of courses, workshops, and tutorials catering to a wide range of interests and skill levels. This democratization of knowledge allows individuals to pursue learning opportunities beyond formal education, fostering a mindset of curiosity and self-improvement.
Moreover, technology has facilitated the creation of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), providing access to high-quality educational content from renowned institutions worldwide. This not only breaks down geographical barriers but also offers a cost-effective alternative for individuals seeking to acquire new skills or deepen their knowledge in specific areas.

"We often say that today's students are tomorrow's future. But we do not think about how today's students can become the bright future who may add a distinctive value for the upcoming generation. We also do not research on which education can make our children skilled and worthy citizens of the country. In the majority of schools and classrooms, it is observed that the students are mainly being assessed on lower-level thinking skills such as memorization and recall.
The multiple-choice, short-answer and matching questions, along with the academic assignments, are majorly dependent on the main modes of assessment or school prescribed methods which are running years after years. Many education commissions are formed to upgrade the education system of the country, but they cannot come out with the so-called systems of teaching and learning in classrooms.
Yes, some initiatives have been taken by some of the educationists of our country like creative questions, higher ability testing, communicative English learning, but it's the fact that the certain no standard modules are patterned which the teachers may follow or standardize their teaching in the classrooms. I think the education system and teaching methodology should be modified and changed into skill-based learning, so that the students of today, can smartly overcome the challenges of the 21st century and occupy a strong position in their workplace.
In the education system, if we cannot emphasize skill-based teaching today's students will have to face various challenges in the 21st century. The researchers foresee the following challenges if we do not be careful of our teaching systems; the challenges are; #Threats to the employment from automation, #The deficiency of manpower, #Shortage of adaptability quality of the educated but not skilled, #Lessening the collaborative thinking, #Worsening the reality of learning, #Dulling the critical thinking and problem-solving qualities, #Degrading the communication skills, #Weakening the management level of thinking, #Exhaustion of finite national resources #Decay of moral and ethical issues associated with digital technology (e.g. data privacy, surveillance culture) and biotechnology, #Slow motion in upgrading education in all sectors, #Threat to the abnormal growth of inefficient population.
Therefore, if we are not aware of how to prepare our students with proper skill and technology, we cannot tackle the challenges, rather it will create an inevitable disaster in the country in future. We need to focus on areas beyond simple content accumulation in the respective subjects of the classes. In a future of unprecedented societal shifts, education is crucial to managing the challenges ahead. The following skills are to be attained for tackling future challenges:
Creativity and Innovation Skills
We know that the global marketplace is more competitive than ever. Innovative products and creative thoughts thrive on an organization's ability to design and present them in aesthetically pleasing ways. Creative thinking and application grab consumers' attention and secures their loyalty. Ultimately, creativity is a common language we can all learn to communicate our passions and ideas with. So, creativity and innovation are just valuable learning pursuits. It's a vital tool to success in school and in the workplace. For this reason, Creativity Fluency is used in thousands of schools all over the world.
The world is always appearing with a lot of changes in this digital age at exponential rates. By the time employees learn the newest software or program, a better version is coming about. Future employers will need to continuously adapt to changing conditions as well as be able to learn new things quickly and efficiently. We need our students to learn how to learn. We deal with trends of every kind constantly. Business, technology, entertainment, communication, and lifestyle trends are just some of the many.
What makes it more challenging is that each major trend can often have several sub-trends of its own. Keeping abreast of these means staying informed and knowing when to take advantage of opportunities. As for life itself, it will always have challenges, no matter how well things are going. Being able to adapt to change in all its forms keeps us constantly prepared to survive and succeed no matter what climate we're in.
In the present world, communication has transformed beyond face-to-face interaction. We communicate using technology more than ever. We have access to a wide variety of new ways to communicate from video-conferencing to social media. In school, we work in groups to produce solutions to the challenges and problems we face.

"We often say that today's students are tomorrow's future. But we do not think about how today's students can become the bright future who may add a distinctive value for the upcoming generation. We also do not research on which education can make our children skilled and worthy citizens of the country. In the majority of schools and classrooms, it is observed that the students are mainly being assessed on lower-level thinking skills such as memorization and recall.
The multiple-choice, short-answer and matching questions, along with the academic assignments, are majorly dependent on the main modes of assessment or school prescribed methods which are running years after years. Many education commissions are formed to upgrade the education system of the country, but they cannot come out with the so-called systems of teaching and learning in classrooms.
Yes, some initiatives have been taken by some of the educationists of our country like creative questions, higher ability testing, communicative English learning, but it's the fact that the certain no standard modules are patterned which the teachers may follow or standardize their teaching in the classrooms. I think the education system and teaching methodology should be modified and changed into skill-based learning, so that the students of today, can smartly overcome the challenges of the 21st century and occupy a strong position in their workplace.
In the education system, if we cannot emphasize skill-based teaching today's students will have to face various challenges in the 21st century. The researchers foresee the following challenges if we do not be careful of our teaching systems; the challenges are; #Threats to the employment from automation, #The deficiency of manpower, #Shortage of adaptability quality of the educated but not skilled, #Lessening the collaborative thinking, #Worsening the reality of learning, #Dulling the critical thinking and problem-solving qualities, #Degrading the communication skills, #Weakening the management level of thinking, #Exhaustion of finite national resources #Decay of moral and ethical issues associated with digital technology (e.g. data privacy, surveillance culture) and biotechnology, #Slow motion in upgrading education in all sectors, #Threat to the abnormal growth of inefficient population.
Therefore, if we are not aware of how to prepare our students with proper skill and technology, we cannot tackle the challenges, rather it will create an inevitable disaster in the country in future. We need to focus on areas beyond simple content accumulation in the respective subjects of the classes. In a future of unprecedented societal shifts, education is crucial to managing the challenges ahead. The following skills are to be attained for tackling future challenges:
Creativity and Innovation Skills
We know that the global marketplace is more competitive than ever. Innovative products and creative thoughts thrive on an organization's ability to design and present them in aesthetically pleasing ways. Creative thinking and application grab consumers' attention and secures their loyalty. Ultimately, creativity is a common language we can all learn to communicate our passions and ideas with. So, creativity and innovation are just valuable learning pursuits. It's a vital tool to success in school and in the workplace. For this reason, Creativity Fluency is used in thousands of schools all over the world.
The world is always appearing with a lot of changes in this digital age at exponential rates. By the time employees learn the newest software or program, a better version is coming about. Future employers will need to continuously adapt to changing conditions as well as be able to learn new things quickly and efficiently. We need our students to learn how to learn. We deal with trends of every kind constantly. Business, technology, entertainment, communication, and lifestyle trends are just some of the many.
What makes it more challenging is that each major trend can often have several sub-trends of its own. Keeping abreast of these means staying informed and knowing when to take advantage of opportunities. As for life itself, it will always have challenges, no matter how well things are going. Being able to adapt to change in all its forms keeps us constantly prepared to survive and succeed no matter what climate we're in.
In the present world, communication has transformed beyond face-to-face interaction. We communicate using technology more than ever.

Digital communication platforms, such as emails, messaging apps, and online portals, facilitate real-time updates on a student's progress, upcoming events, and important announcements. This seamless communication enhances parental involvement in a child's education, creating a collaborative partnership between educators and families.
Additionally, parents can actively participate in their child's learning journey through online resources and interactive platforms. This not only strengthens the support system for students but also fosters a sense of community within the school environment.
Economic Opportunities and Entrepreneurship
The integration of technology in education aligns with the demands of the contemporary job market. Students equipped with technological skills are better positioned to navigate the professional landscape and contribute to economic growth. Moreover, technology facilitates the development of entrepreneurial skills, empowering students to explore innovative solutions and turn their ideas into viable ventures.
Online platforms also provide opportunities for skill development in emerging fields, allowing individuals to acquire in-demand skills that are crucial for career advancement. This connectivity to the digital economy prepares students for the dynamic nature of the modern workplace and encourages a mindset of adaptability and resilience.
Conclusion: Balancing the Waves of Change
The impact of technology on education is profound, reshaping the landscape of learning in once unimaginable ways.

"Empowering Global Citizens: The Transformative Power of Global Education
Global Education: Empowering the Next Generation
In an increasingly interconnected world, global education has emerged as a crucial component of preparing students for the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century. It goes beyond traditional academic subjects, aiming to foster global citizenship, cultural understanding, and a sense of shared responsibility for our planet.
Global education equips students with the knowledge, skills, and attitudes necessary to navigate an interconnected world. It encourages them to think critically about global issues such as poverty, climate change, human rights, and social justice. By examining these complex challenges from multiple perspectives, students develop empathy and gain a deeper understanding of the world around them.
One key aspect of global education is promoting cultural competence. In our diverse societies, it is essential for students to appreciate and respect different cultures and traditions. By learning about other cultures’ histories, languages, religions, and customs, students develop a broader worldview that fosters tolerance and inclusivity.
Moreover, global education encourages interdisciplinary learning by integrating various subjects such as geography, history, economics, environmental science, and social studies. This multidisciplinary approach helps students connect the dots between different disciplines and understand how they intersect in addressing global challenges.
Technology plays a pivotal role in global education by breaking down geographical barriers. Through virtual exchanges and online collaborations with peers from different countries or cultures, students can engage in meaningful dialogue and learn from one another’s perspectives. These digital connections enable them to develop cross-cultural communication skills essential for success in today’s interconnected workforce.
Global education also emphasizes active engagement through service-learning projects or community involvement. By participating in local or international initiatives aimed at addressing social issues like poverty or inequality, students develop a sense of agency and realize their potential to make a positive impact on their communities – both locally and globally.
Furthermore, global education prepares students for an increasingly globalized job market. Employers are seeking individuals with intercultural competence who can collaborate effectively across borders and understand the complexities of global markets. By nurturing skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, adaptability, and cultural sensitivity, global education equips students with a competitive edge in today’s global workforce.
To ensure the success of global education, collaboration among educators, policymakers, and communities is crucial. Governments must prioritize the integration of global education into national curricula and provide professional development opportunities for teachers to enhance their knowledge and pedagogical strategies.
In conclusion, global education is a transformative approach that empowers the next generation to become active global citizens. By fostering cultural understanding, critical thinking, and a sense of shared responsibility, it equips students with the skills needed to navigate an interconnected world. As we strive for a more inclusive and sustainable future, investing in global education is not just desirable but imperative. Together, let us empower our students to create positive change on a local and global scale.

Building Safe Spaces: Ensuring Community Security
Creating safe spaces is essential for community well-being. By actively working towards community safety, we can ensure that everyone feels protected and supported. This section will explore various strategies and initiatives that can contribute to a safer environment.
Neighborhood Watch Programs
Neighborhood watch programs play a crucial role in preventing and deterring crime within communities. These programs involve residents collaborating with local law enforcement agencies to monitor and report suspicious activities. By keeping a watchful eye on their neighborhoods, participants contribute to a heightened sense of security and help establish a strong community bond. To start a neighborhood watch program in your area, reach out to your local police department or community organization for guidance and support.
Being prepared for emergencies is essential in safeguarding the community. Creating emergency plans and organizing training sessions can help community members respond effectively in crisis situations. This can include establishing communication channels, conducting drills, and educating residents about emergency procedures. By equipping individuals with the knowledge and skills necessary to handle emergencies, we can enhance the overall safety and resilience of our community.
Crime Prevention Initiatives
Preventing crime requires proactive efforts and community involvement. Collaborating with local law enforcement agencies and community organizations, residents can implement crime prevention initiatives. These initiatives may include organizing awareness campaigns, hosting educational workshops, and implementing security measures such as improved lighting and surveillance systems. By addressing the root causes of crime and fostering an environment that discourages criminal activities, we can create a safer community for everyone.","How can the lack of affordable housing options in a community affect the overall educational attainment of its residents, and what potential solutions can be implemented to mitigate this impact?","The lack of affordable housing options in a community can affect the overall educational attainment of its residents in several ways. Firstly, it can lead to overcrowding, which can negatively impact the quality of education children receive. Secondly, it can lead to increased stress and anxiety among parents, which can affect their ability to provide a stable and supportive environment for their children's education. Additionally, the lack of affordable housing can also lead to increased mobility, which can disrupt children's education and make it difficult for them to establish a sense of stability and continuity.

Potential solutions to mitigate the impact of lack of affordable housing on educational attainment include:

1. Increasing the supply of affordable housing options: This can be achieved through government initiatives, such as subsidies and tax credits, as well as private sector investments in affordable housing developments.
2. Implementing policies to reduce housing costs: This can include rent control measures, subsidies for low-income families, and programs to help families access affordable housing.
3. Providing support services to families: This can include counseling, job training, and education programs to help families access affordable housing and improve their overall well-being.
4. Improving access to education: This can include increasing funding for schools, providing resources for teachers, and implementing programs to support students' educational needs.
5. Encouraging community engagement: This can include community-based initiatives, such as mentorship programs, tutoring, and volunteer opportunities, to support students' educational attainment.

It is essential to recognize that the relationship between affordable housing and educational attainment is complex and multifaceted. Therefore, a comprehensive approach that addresses the various factors contributing to the lack of affordable housing and its impact on educational attainment is necessary to achieve meaningful change.","['https://nhc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/The-Impacts-of-Affordable-Housing-on-Education-1.pdf', 'https://housingmatters.urban.org/articles/how-housing-can-determine-educational-health-and-economic-outcomes', 'https://www.greatermatthewshabitat.org/education', 'https://www.habitat.org/sites/default/files/documents/21-81776_RD_EvidenceBrief-6-Education_FASH-lores_1.pdf', 'https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/103472/why-housing-matters-for-upward-mobility-evidence-and-indicators-for-practitioners-and-policymakers.pdf', 'https://www.habitat.org/our-work/impact/research-series-how-does-housing-affect-childrens-education', 'https://www.huduser.gov/portal/pdredge/pdr_edge_frm_asst_sec_030915.html', 'https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hpb20180817.901935/', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK425845/', 'https://www.young.senate.gov/news/press-releases/icymi-young-stepping-up-efforts-to-improve-housing_/', 'https://nhc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/The-Impacts-of-Affordable-Housing-on-Education-1.pdf', 'https://housingmatters.urban.org/articles/how-housing-can-determine-educational-health-and-economic-outcomes', 'https://www.greatermatthewshabitat.org/education', 'https://www.habitat.org/sites/default/files/documents/21-81776_RD_EvidenceBrief-6-Education_FASH-lores_1.pdf', 'https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/103472/why-housing-matters-for-upward-mobility-evidence-and-indicators-for-practitioners-and-policymakers.pdf', 'https://www.habitat.org/our-work/impact/research-series-how-does-housing-affect-childrens-education', 'https://www.huduser.gov/portal/pdredge/pdr_edge_frm_asst_sec_030915.html', 'https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hpb20180817.901935/', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK425845/', 'https://www.young.senate.gov/news/press-releases/icymi-young-stepping-up-efforts-to-improve-housing_/', 'https://nhc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/The-Impacts-of-Affordable-Housing-on-Education-1.pdf', 'https://housingmatters.urban.org/articles/how-housing-can-determine-educational-health-and-economic-outcomes', 'https://www.greatermatthewshabitat.org/education', 'https://www.habitat.org/sites/default/files/documents/21-81776_RD_EvidenceBrief-6-Education_FASH-lores_1.pdf', 'https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/103472/why-housing-matters-for-upward-mobility-evidence-and-indicators-for-practitioners-and-policymakers.pdf', 'https://www.habitat.org/our-work/impact/research-series-how-does-housing-affect-childrens-education', 'https://www.huduser.gov/portal/pdredge/pdr_edge_frm_asst_sec_030915.html', 'https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hpb20180817.901935/', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK425845/', 'https://www.young.senate.gov/news/press-releases/icymi-young-stepping-up-efforts-to-improve-housing_/']",education

Building Safe Spaces: Ensuring Community Security
Creating safe spaces is essential for community well-being. By actively working towards community safety, we can ensure that everyone feels protected and supported. This section will explore various strategies and initiatives that can contribute to a safer environment.
Neighborhood Watch Programs
Neighborhood watch programs play a crucial role in preventing and deterring crime within communities. These programs involve residents collaborating with local law enforcement agencies to monitor and report suspicious activities. By keeping a watchful eye on their neighborhoods, participants contribute to a heightened sense of security and help establish a strong community bond. To start a neighborhood watch program in your area, reach out to your local police department or community organization for guidance and support.
Being prepared for emergencies is essential in safeguarding the community. Creating emergency plans and organizing training sessions can help community members respond effectively in crisis situations. This can include establishing communication channels, conducting drills, and educating residents about emergency procedures. By equipping individuals with the knowledge and skills necessary to handle emergencies, we can enhance the overall safety and resilience of our community.
Crime Prevention Initiatives
Preventing crime requires proactive efforts and community involvement. Collaborating with local law enforcement agencies and community organizations, residents can implement crime prevention initiatives. These initiatives may include organizing awareness campaigns, hosting educational workshops, and implementing security measures such as improved lighting and surveillance systems. By addressing the root causes of crime and fostering an environment that discourages criminal activities, we can create a safer community for everyone.","** What strategies can community leaders use to encourage residents to take an active role in preparing for natural disasters, and how can this preparedness impact the overall resilience of the community?","Community leaders can employ various strategies to encourage residents to take an active role in preparing for natural disasters, ultimately enhancing the overall resilience of the community.","['https://extension.psu.edu/a-community-approach-to-disaster-preparedness-and-response', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK573904/', 'https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-07/whole_community_dec2011__2.pdf', 'https://information.auditor.ca.gov/pdfs/reports/2019-103.pdf', 'https://bja.ojp.gov/sites/g/files/xyckuh186/files/Publications/NSA_NW_Manual.pdf', 'http://information.auditor.ca.gov/reports/2019-103/chapters.html', 'https://www.epa.gov/sourcewaterprotection/how-can-you-help-protect-source-water', 'https://www.houstontx.gov/mayor/Resilient-Houston-20200518-single-page.pdf', 'https://www.mdcinc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/When-Disaster-Strikes-Promising-Practices-Mobile-Home-Residents.pdf', 'https://www.nyc.gov/site/em/ready/get-prepared.page', 'https://extension.psu.edu/a-community-approach-to-disaster-preparedness-and-response', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK573904/', 'https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-07/whole_community_dec2011__2.pdf', 'https://information.auditor.ca.gov/pdfs/reports/2019-103.pdf', 'https://bja.ojp.gov/sites/g/files/xyckuh186/files/Publications/NSA_NW_Manual.pdf', 'http://information.auditor.ca.gov/reports/2019-103/chapters.html', 'https://www.epa.gov/sourcewaterprotection/how-can-you-help-protect-source-water', 'https://www.houstontx.gov/mayor/Resilient-Houston-20200518-single-page.pdf', 'https://www.mdcinc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/When-Disaster-Strikes-Promising-Practices-Mobile-Home-Residents.pdf', 'https://www.nyc.gov/site/em/ready/get-prepared.page', 'https://extension.psu.edu/a-community-approach-to-disaster-preparedness-and-response', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK573904/', 'https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-07/whole_community_dec2011__2.pdf', 'https://information.auditor.ca.gov/pdfs/reports/2019-103.pdf', 'https://bja.ojp.gov/sites/g/files/xyckuh186/files/Publications/NSA_NW_Manual.pdf', 'http://information.auditor.ca.gov/reports/2019-103/chapters.html', 'https://www.epa.gov/sourcewaterprotection/how-can-you-help-protect-source-water', 'https://www.houstontx.gov/mayor/Resilient-Houston-20200518-single-page.pdf', 'https://www.mdcinc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/When-Disaster-Strikes-Promising-Practices-Mobile-Home-Residents.pdf', 'https://www.nyc.gov/site/em/ready/get-prepared.page']",education

Use of Text-Matching Software","How do you think a teacher could demonstrate their ability to use creativity, critical thinking, analysis, and research skills to solve a complex educational problem, and what are some potential challenges they might face in doing so?","To demonstrate their ability to use creativity, critical thinking, analysis, and research skills to solve a complex educational problem, a teacher could follow a structured approach. This approach would involve identifying the problem, gathering relevant information, analyzing the data, and developing creative solutions. The teacher would also need to consider the perspectives of various stakeholders, including students, parents, and colleagues.

Here are some potential challenges that a teacher might face in demonstrating their ability to use creativity, critical thinking, analysis, and research skills to solve a complex educational problem:

1. Lack of resources: The teacher may not have access to the necessary resources, such as technology or expert consultants, to effectively solve the problem.

2. Limited time: The teacher may have limited time to devote to solving the problem, which could make it difficult to gather all the necessary information and develop a comprehensive solution.

3. Resistance to change: Some stakeholders, such as parents or colleagues, may be resistant to change and may not be open to new ideas or solutions.

4. Complexity of the problem: The problem may be complex and multifaceted, making it difficult to identify the root cause and develop an effective solution.

5. Limited expertise: The teacher may not have the necessary expertise or knowledge to effectively solve the problem, which could make it difficult to develop a comprehensive solution.

6. Limited support: The teacher may not have the necessary support or guidance from administrators or colleagues to effectively solve the problem.

7. Limited student engagement: The teacher may struggle to engage students in the problem-solving process, which could make it difficult to develop a comprehensive solution.

8. Limited parental involvement: The teacher may struggle to involve parents in the problem-solving process, which could make it difficult to develop a comprehensive solution.

9. Limited community involvement: The teacher may struggle to involve the community in the problem-solving process, which could make it difficult to develop a comprehensive solution.

10. Limited budget: The teacher may have a limited budget to devote to solving the problem, which could make it difficult to gather all the necessary resources and develop a comprehensive solution.

By considering these potential challenges, a teacher can develop a comprehensive plan to effectively solve a complex educational problem and demonstrate their ability to use creativity, critical thinking, analysis, and research skills.","['https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10054602/', 'https://www.edutopia.org/article/teaching-critical-thinking-middle-high-school/', 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10888691.2018.1537791', 'https://www.quora.com/How-can-a-teacher-enhance-critical-thinking-and-problem-solving-among-learners', 'https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/comprehensive-guide-21st-century-skills', 'https://cetl.uconn.edu/resources/design-your-course/teaching-and-learning-techniques/critical-thinking-and-other-higher-order-thinking-skills/', 'https://dl.sps.northwestern.edu/blog/2015/09/using-technology-to-develop-students-critical-thinking-skills/', 'https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED519336.pdf', 'https://www.marietta.edu/sites/default/files/documents/21st_century_skills_standards_book_2.pdf', 'https://psyche.co/guides/how-to-solve-problems-by-thinking-like-a-detective', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10054602/', 'https://www.edutopia.org/article/teaching-critical-thinking-middle-high-school/', 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10888691.2018.1537791', 'https://www.quora.com/How-can-a-teacher-enhance-critical-thinking-and-problem-solving-among-learners', 'https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/comprehensive-guide-21st-century-skills', 'https://cetl.uconn.edu/resources/design-your-course/teaching-and-learning-techniques/critical-thinking-and-other-higher-order-thinking-skills/', 'https://dl.sps.northwestern.edu/blog/2015/09/using-technology-to-develop-students-critical-thinking-skills/', 'https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED519336.pdf', 'https://www.marietta.edu/sites/default/files/documents/21st_century_skills_standards_book_2.pdf', 'https://psyche.co/guides/how-to-solve-problems-by-thinking-like-a-detective']",education

Use of Text-Matching Software","How might incorporating story-as-method into classroom practice influence the development of teachers' professional identities, and what implications might this have for teacher education programs?","The incorporation of story-as-method into classroom practice may influence the development of teachers' professional identities by allowing them to reposition themselves according to plot and story, which can shape their sense of agency and identity as educators. This approach can also help teachers to reflect on their teaching practices and develop a more nuanced understanding of their role in the classroom. In terms of teacher education programs, incorporating story-as-method may help to strengthen students' emerging professional identities and prepare them for the complexities of teaching.

The search results provide a range of perspectives on the potential impact of incorporating story-as-method into classroom practice on teachers' professional identities and teacher education programs. Some studies suggest that this approach can help to shape teachers' sense of agency and identity, while others highlight the importance of considering multiple perspectives in the development of teaching practices.

The concept of multiperspectivity is particularly relevant in this context, as it highlights the importance of considering multiple viewpoints and perspectives in the development of teaching practices. This approach can help to promote a more nuanced understanding of teaching and learning, and can also help to prepare teachers for the complexities of the classroom.

In terms of implications for teacher education programs, incorporating story-as-method may help to strengthen students' emerging professional identities and prepare them for the complexities of teaching. This approach can also help to promote a more nuanced understanding of teaching and learning, and can provide teachers with the skills and knowledge they need to develop effective teaching practices.

Overall, the incorporation of story-as-method into classroom practice has the potential to influence the development of teachers' professional identities and teacher education programs in a number of ways. By allowing teachers to reposition themselves according to plot and story, this approach can help to shape their sense of agency and identity as educators. Additionally, incorporating multiple perspectives and considering the complexities of teaching and learning can help to promote a more nuanced understanding of teaching and learning, and can provide teachers with the skills and knowledge they need to develop effective teaching practices.","['https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0742051X21002523', 'https://www.humanrestorationproject.org/writing/who-is-being-sold-a-story-unsettling-the-science-of-reading', 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13540602.2019.1542871', 'https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/culturally-responsive-teaching-culturally-responsive-pedagogy/2022/04', 'https://digitalcommons.odu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1073&context=teachinglearning_etds', 'https://as.tufts.edu/education/academics/courses', 'https://www.naeyc.org/resources/pubs/vop/dec2023/intro', 'https://education.uw.edu/about/directory/manka-varghese', 'https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.3102/0013189X019005002', 'https://www.naeyc.org/resources/pubs/yc/summer2021/learning-stories', 'https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1230321.pdf', 'https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0255761420952215', 'https://stemeducationjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40594-018-0131-6', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221503902400016X', 'https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/education/articles/10.3389/feduc.2023.1134848/pdf', 'https://education.uw.edu/about/directory/manka-varghese', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10977959/', 'https://ijccep.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40723-022-00099-9', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8824257/', 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09500782.2023.2244915', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiperspectivity', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/2s0m31/what_do_you_do_when_you_have_to_edit_multiple/', 'https://ada.osu.edu/multiple-perspectives-conference/multiple-perspectives-2024', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/litrpg/comments/lvruib/do_you_enjoy_novels_with_multiple_perspectives/', 'https://community.hubspot.com/t5/Advocates-Blog/Why-We-Need-to-Define-Community-Through-Multiple-Perspectives/ba-p/744551', 'https://mspguide.org/2022/03/18/multiple-perspectives/', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5812509/', 'https://www.literacywithlesley.com/multiple-voices--multiple-perspectives.html', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0263237307000576', 'https://support.outschool.com/en/articles/5091194-understanding-multiple-perspectives']",education

Use of Text-Matching Software","How can educational institutions balance the need for community engagement with the need to maintain academic standards, and what role do Indigenous ways of knowing, being, and doing play in this balance?","The role of Indigenous ways of knowing, being, and doing in balancing community engagement with academic standards in educational institutions is multifaceted and requires a nuanced understanding of the complex relationships between these concepts.

Indigenous ways of knowing, being, and doing emphasize the importance of community, respect, and responsibility in educational settings. This approach recognizes that Indigenous knowledge and perspectives are valuable and essential to the learning process. By incorporating Indigenous ways of knowing, being, and doing into educational institutions, educators can create a more inclusive and culturally responsive learning environment that acknowledges the historical and ongoing impacts of colonization on Indigenous communities.

In terms of balancing community engagement with academic standards, Indigenous ways of knowing, being, and doing can help educators prioritize community needs and concerns while maintaining academic rigor. For example, Indigenous educators can work with community members to develop curriculum that is relevant and meaningful to their lives, while also ensuring that academic standards are met.

Moreover, Indigenous ways of knowing, being, and doing can help educators recognize and address the systemic barriers and biases that can impact Indigenous students' academic success. By incorporating Indigenous perspectives and knowledge into educational settings, educators can create a more inclusive and equitable learning environment that supports the academic success of all students.

In conclusion, the role of Indigenous ways of knowing, being, and doing in balancing community engagement with academic standards in educational institutions is critical. By recognizing and valuing Indigenous knowledge and perspectives, educators can create a more inclusive and culturally responsive learning environment that supports the academic success of all students.","['https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/school-discipline/guiding-principles.pdf', 'https://www.education.pa.gov/Teachers%20-%20Administrators/Curriculum/Math/Pages/default.aspx', 'https://nces.ed.gov/npec/pdf/kuh_team_report.pdf', 'https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/lcfffaq.asp', 'https://www.michigan.gov/mde/services/academic-standards/instruction/balanced-assessment-systems', 'https://www.ncaa.org/sports/2013/11/15/division-ii-philosophy-statement.aspx', 'https://www.ctc.ca.gov/docs/default-source/educator-prep/standards/cpsel-booklet-2014.pdf', 'https://www.ccp.edu/degrees-programs/all-academic-offerings/online-learning', 'https://education.mn.gov/MDE/dse/schfin/fin/UFARS/', 'https://sde.ok.gov/sites/default/files/documents/files/Oklahoma%20Academic%20Standards%20for%20Social%20Studies%205.21.19.pdf', 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14443050309387838', 'https://opentextbc.ca/indigenizationfrontlineworkers/chapter/indigenous-ways-of-knowing-and-being/', 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08941920.2023.2180696', 'https://weallcount.com/2021/04/16/learning-from-indigenous-ways-of-knowing/', 'https://taylorinstitute.ucalgary.ca/resources/indigenous-ways-of-knowing-course-design', 'https://abclifeliteracy.ca/blog-posts/how-to-incorporate-indigenous-ways-of-knowing-into-your-teaching/', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5502907/', 'https://ajie.atsis.uq.edu.au/ajie/article/view/266', 'https://journals.uvic.ca/index.php/winhec/article/view/20293', 'https://www.queensu.ca/indigenous/ways-knowing/about']",education

Throughout the unit you will be asked to complete a range of readings from the Reading List on Canvas. We have kept the reading list minimal so you have time to engage with them, using them as a lens to reflect upon and interpret your story as well as to contemplate the future of school-based teaching and learning. Additional documents to be read will occasionally be included in the Modules.
Submission of assessment items
Extensions & Late submissions
Approval of extenuating circumstances will be dependent upon the production of supporting documentation and at the discretion of the unit convener.
All assessment items required to be submitted online must be submitted via the appropriate Canvas drop box. It is the student's responsibility to upload the correct and corresponding draft or assessment item to the right submission section. Assignments must be submitted in a format accessible to the assessor(s), as stated on the relevant canvas site. If the unit convener and/or tutor are unable to access a submission, a standard late penalty of 5% of the total marks possible for the task may be applied per day until the assignment is made accessible.
Special assessment requirements
Normally, an aggregate mark of 50% is required to pass this unit. This unit also requires succesful completion of the professional experience component.
Students have a responsibility to uphold University standards on ethical scholarship. Good scholarship involves building on the work of others and use of others' work must be acknowledged with proper attribution made. Cheating, plagiarism, and falsification of data are dishonest practices that contravene academic values. Refer to the University's Student Charter for more information.
To enhance understanding of academic integrity, all students are expected to complete the Academic Integrity Module (AIM) at least once during their course of study.

"Okay, how do I follow that? Hello, my name is John Cope, and I'm Head of Education and Skills Policy at the CBI. The Confederation of British Industry represents about 190,000 businesses also. So my job is kind of one foot in business, listen to CEOs, managing directors of companies of all sizes, all sectors across the UK and internationally. But also we have a sort of a microcosm of the education system in membership as well says that 80 or 90 universities that are members of the CBI, including Nottingham Trent, with 40 or 50 colleges are members. We also have really strong links with school trusts, as well as the independent sector. So I kind of come at this from a from both angles and in those conversations. ones that I have for business leaders, it doesn't take very long until the topic of conversation goes to education skills, it does tend to be the number one priority for them. And it's that kind of mix of wanting a more productive, more vibrant economy. Combined with that kind of social good aspects of education, make sure everyone gets a good start in life. And I have a really strong belief actually, the employers have a huge role to play education skills, and a mentor or point officer role, the duty to do so to get involved with schools getting by with colleges and universities. And too often that role can be not quite as advanced as it could be. And I suppose the thing I would add about my work at the CBI education skills is that we come from the start point, but there is no reason why a young person shouldn't have a fantastic career. Every young person should have that career. There is no reason why you should have regional differences, why different young people from different backgrounds should start their career in a different way. So we come from that start point that talent is equally distributed, but opportunity is not. And and employers have a role in affecting that. And despite the million plus, or so students who they're good or outstanding school, and over the last 10 years or so, despite the very welcome, focus on rigor and knowledge in the curriculum, and also the sort of innovation in education that a lot of Multi Academy Trusts are pursuing, it still remains the case that there is a significant disadvantage gap means young people at the age of 16 can be nearly two years behind the more advantaged peers. And from a CBI perspective, not only is that morally questionable, and we allow that situation to happen, but actually that disadvantage gap is lost business leaders, it's lost scientists, it's lost innovators, lost leaders of the future. And we have a duty to address it.
Thank you very much. And I'm going to start the questioning off with a little reflection really of my own IT digital background in that when I started teaching, and we didn't have computers, and and we certainly didn't have the digital natives that we now have in our classrooms. And I've got two daughters, who, you know, the the technology is as comfortable with them as a book, you know, as it was with when I was growing up. So, in terms of the future, what skills are young people our digital natives going to need for the future? And how can schools provide them when they're staffed by a lot of people who weren't digital natives? Maybe Nancy first?
Yeah, very happy to take this one first. And I actually think so. So I think it's a really interesting question, and I actually feel like there's some of the skills that are most needed in the kind of work. I was on a panel yesterday talking about the fourth industrial revolution. So I don't really like that term that much. But considering technology is changing all of our lives and automation is going to change lots of the jobs that young people are going to go into in the future. I actually kind of think, alongside the digital skills that you've mentioned, it's the skills or kind of more human skills that we really need to foster in young people. Things like collaboration and problem solving, we know is really important teamwork, as well as the social and social and emotional skills and resilience that are going to be so important in our in our changing world as we as we all know it. Nesta produce some research a couple of years ago on the future of work and found that the skills I've just mentioned, those are most likely to grow in the future world of work and be important. So I think although we do completely appreciate that the role of technology and people need to have access to that, but actually, it's alongside those human skills that will make the real difference to people and how they thrive in the future.

"Okay, how do I follow that? Hello, my name is John Cope, and I'm Head of Education and Skills Policy at the CBI. The Confederation of British Industry represents about 190,000 businesses also. So my job is kind of one foot in business, listen to CEOs, managing directors of companies of all sizes, all sectors across the UK and internationally. But also we have a sort of a microcosm of the education system in membership as well says that 80 or 90 universities that are members of the CBI, including Nottingham Trent, with 40 or 50 colleges are members. We also have really strong links with school trusts, as well as the independent sector. So I kind of come at this from a from both angles and in those conversations. ones that I have for business leaders, it doesn't take very long until the topic of conversation goes to education skills, it does tend to be the number one priority for them. And it's that kind of mix of wanting a more productive, more vibrant economy. Combined with that kind of social good aspects of education, make sure everyone gets a good start in life. And I have a really strong belief actually, the employers have a huge role to play education skills, and a mentor or point officer role, the duty to do so to get involved with schools getting by with colleges and universities. And too often that role can be not quite as advanced as it could be. And I suppose the thing I would add about my work at the CBI education skills is that we come from the start point, but there is no reason why a young person shouldn't have a fantastic career. Every young person should have that career. There is no reason why you should have regional differences, why different young people from different backgrounds should start their career in a different way. So we come from that start point that talent is equally distributed, but opportunity is not. And and employers have a role in affecting that. And despite the million plus, or so students who they're good or outstanding school, and over the last 10 years or so, despite the very welcome, focus on rigor and knowledge in the curriculum, and also the sort of innovation in education that a lot of Multi Academy Trusts are pursuing, it still remains the case that there is a significant disadvantage gap means young people at the age of 16 can be nearly two years behind the more advantaged peers.

Thank you very much.

And I've got two daughters, who, you know, the the technology is as comfortable with them as a book, you know, as it was with when I was growing up. So, in terms of the future, what skills are young people our digital natives going to need for the future? And how can schools provide them when they're staffed by a lot of people who weren't digital natives? Maybe Nancy first?
Yeah, very happy to take this one first. And I actually think so. So I think it's a really interesting question, and I actually feel like there's some of the skills that are most needed in the kind of work. I was on a panel yesterday talking about the fourth industrial revolution. So I don't really like that term that much. But considering technology is changing all of our lives and automation is going to change lots of the jobs that young people are going to go into in the future.

"1. Foundational Knowledge
Remembering and understanding information. Other kinds of learning build from this base of content knowledge.
Students learn how to engage in some new kind of action, which may be intellectual, physical, social, etc. Learning how to engage in various kinds of thinking (critical, creative, practical) is also an important form of application learning.
Making connections between ideas, learning experiences or subject areas. These are often the deeper underlying rules or processes that connect what may at first appear to be disconnected phenomena.
4. Human Dimension
Learning about yourself and others. This may mean how the material applies to students and those around them, how accomplishing a task or difficult project might reflect on the student (self-image), or what these accomplishments might mean for their future goals (self-ideal).
Developing interest or value for the topic within students. If you have chosen a topic to teach because it is important, often you will want students to develop a similar appreciation.

"School communities have experienced a radical change in the way education is delivered in the past few years. While these changes, such as remote, online and blended learning have undoubtedly expanded the reach of educational resources and experiences, there are still challenges ahead. It is imperative that in promoting new methods for delivering education at all levels we do not forget to lay strong foundations.
In order to make use of innovative tools, teachers, students and administrators alike need to be supported over a while. This entails training, financial resources and activities tailored to strengthen learning communities. New technologies should be welcomed but not at the expense of those that use them. Users of digital platforms should have clear information about the use of their data and governments should protect their citizens from seemingly free software that capitalizes on user’s data. Education should remain accessible, and become more accessible where it is not already.
Just like the Twin Transition has become central in achieving both the Digital and the Green transition, schools should be supported in multiple ways. If we can recognise their crucial role in every society, we must reconcile with the fact that it is complex and needs the right roles in order to keep functioning, leaving no one behind.
Students are not in school for one specific objective and schools should not be operating like factories or enterprises. Students and learners must remain central and safeguarded. If we want future generations to be better equipped we should look into the knowledge and needs of those that are here now. This means more representation of all the groups that make up a school. Their needs and insight are crucial to tackling issues, from the implementation of new technologies to the fight against social inequality. If schools are seen as the vessel of most social and societal changes, then we must equip schools with the resources to tackle a variety of issues simultaneously, instead of channelling resources into a few.
Written by: Sara Mandis","How can schools balance the need for personalized learning with the potential for data privacy concerns, and what role can governments play in ensuring that education is both accessible and protected?","The final answer to the question ""How can schools balance the need for personalized learning with the potential for data privacy concerns, and what role can governments play in ensuring that education is both accessible and protected?"" is:

Schools can balance the need for personalized learning with data privacy concerns by implementing measures such as anonymizing and encrypting student data, providing clear privacy policies, and ensuring that teachers and students are aware of data privacy issues. Governments can play a crucial role in ensuring that education is both accessible and protected by implementing policies and regulations that prioritize student data privacy, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union.

Governments can also provide funding and resources to support schools in implementing data privacy measures, and can work to educate the public about the importance of data privacy in education. Additionally, governments can establish clear guidelines and standards for the collection and use of student data, and can provide oversight and enforcement mechanisms to ensure that schools and educational institutions are complying with data privacy laws and regulations.

In terms of balancing personalized learning with data privacy concerns, schools can use techniques such as data minimization, which involves collecting and storing only the minimum amount of data necessary to achieve the desired learning outcomes. Schools can also use pseudonymization, which involves replacing personally identifiable information with a pseudonym or alias, to protect student data.

Furthermore, schools can use data analytics and machine learning algorithms to personalize learning without compromising student data privacy. For example, schools can use algorithms that do not require the collection of personally identifiable information, or that use aggregated and anonymized data to make predictions about student learning outcomes.

In conclusion, balancing personalized learning with data privacy concerns requires a nuanced approach that involves implementing measures to protect student data, providing clear privacy policies, and ensuring that teachers and students are aware of data privacy issues. Governments can play a crucial role in ensuring that education is both accessible and protected by implementing policies and regulations that prioritize student data privacy, and by providing funding and resources to support schools in implementing data privacy measures.","['https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8455229/', 'https://edtechmagazine.com/k12/article/2019/05/how-k-12-schools-can-balance-privacy-and-security-protocols', 'https://www2.ed.gov/documents/ai-report/ai-report.pdf', 'https://www.edweek.org/technology/massive-shift-to-remote-learning-prompts-big-data-privacy-concerns/2020/03', 'https://globalonlineacademy.org/insights/articles/how-schools-can-elevate-their-ai-strategy', 'https://www.eschoolnews.com/digital-learning/2024/02/05/what-are-the-benefits-and-risks-of-artificial-intelligence-in-education/', 'https://www.linkedin.com/advice/0/balancing-student-data-privacy-personalized-inwwc', 'https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2019/11/15/americans-and-privacy-concerned-confused-and-feeling-lack-of-control-over-their-personal-information/', 'https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/15/16/12451', 'https://www.harvardonline.harvard.edu/course/data-privacy-technology', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/equity/', 'https://www.ada.gov/resources/2024-03-08-web-rule/', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ai-bill-of-rights/', 'https://www.ada.gov/resources/disability-rights-guide/', 'https://www.eeoc.gov/fact-sheet/federal-laws-prohibiting-job-discrimination-questions-and-answers', 'https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/02/government-responsibility-to-citizens-anne-marie-slaughter/', 'https://www.epa.gov/aboutepa/our-mission-and-what-we-do', 'https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ofccp/faqs/AAFAQs', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7734391/', 'https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/disability/ada', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8455229/', 'https://edtechmagazine.com/k12/article/2019/05/how-k-12-schools-can-balance-privacy-and-security-protocols', 'https://www2.ed.gov/documents/ai-report/ai-report.pdf', 'https://www.edweek.org/technology/massive-shift-to-remote-learning-prompts-big-data-privacy-concerns/2020/03', 'https://globalonlineacademy.org/insights/articles/how-schools-can-elevate-their-ai-strategy', 'https://www.eschoolnews.com/digital-learning/2024/02/05/what-are-the-benefits-and-risks-of-artificial-intelligence-in-education/', 'https://www.linkedin.com/advice/0/balancing-student-data-privacy-personalized-inwwc', 'https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2019/11/15/americans-and-privacy-concerned-confused-and-feeling-lack-of-control-over-their-personal-information/', 'https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/15/16/12451', 'https://www.harvardonline.harvard.edu/course/data-privacy-technology']",education

"Yeah, they are. I would add, I suppose that is to reinforce just how critical this is, you know, we often do surveys of our members. And whenever we ask them about where their vacancies are, where their skills gaps, we have a very consistent number that about two thirds of our members will come back and say, actually, they have digital vacancies. So they have jobs there in digital, they cannot fill. And digital is the area where they know they're going to have great skill gaps over the coming years and will invest the most. So for solutions, which I guess is at the heart of this question, I think the first thing is to try and get away from thinking of digital as a subject. And, you know, we used to have ICT lessons and things like that, and I know I did, I had a one hour or month or something like that there was on ICT. I never quite know what the value of that that was. So I think he's getting away from it as a subject and actually viewing it much more along the same lines as numeracy literacy. Actually, digital needs to be weaved into every single subject. And it needs to be core to everything. And so I suppose it's that first year getting getting away from as a subject and thinking of it much more as a competency is something that that should be embedded. The second point I'd make, I suppose, is about the breadth of the curriculum. And this is quite sort of quite a wide point I suppose to make just about, I'd say obviously what is the point of GCSE is now given that most young people are all young people stay in educational change at what is the purpose of GCSEs at 16. So, you know, our members of regularly will sort of say to us that they feel that young people are getting a more and more and more narrow curriculum, and how can that be broadened? So one of the questions that were asking at the CBI do regularly ask of government is, is now the right time to start that conversation about rethinking GCSEs entirely about was the point exams, huge amount of pressure and capacity put into 16, but actually mostly stay in to 18 and that that creates the opportunity to have a lot more creativity subjects which have declined over the last 10 years. It also broadens out to help this show be embedded in more and on to the next stage who some amazing analysis done by the Royal Society, about A-Levels over how disadvantaged young people, on average to 2.4 A-Levels to 2.4 subjects. So the idea that a young person by the age of 18 can narrow themselves down to less than three subjects at the age of 18. feels wrong to me. And I think the the changing world of work, globalisation, ai automation requires greater breadth than ever. And yet we're going the opposite direction and actually narrowing down and I I would add on then on to the next stage on to higher education and technical, first and higher education. And I think culturally, and regulatory and pretty much every part of the system and the financial system drives universities to very traditional approaches to higher education. Everything drives towards three year bachelor's degrees. And that's sort of what everyone hopes for that's the sign of success that parents looking for and that's what the finance system encourages.

"Yeah, they are. I would add, I suppose that is to reinforce just how critical this is, you know, we often do surveys of our members. And whenever we ask them about where their vacancies are, where their skills gaps, we have a very consistent number that about two thirds of our members will come back and say, actually, they have digital vacancies. So they have jobs there in digital, they cannot fill. And digital is the area where they know they're going to have great skill gaps over the coming years and will invest the most. So for solutions, which I guess is at the heart of this question, I think the first thing is to try and get away from thinking of digital as a subject. And, you know, we used to have ICT lessons and things like that, and I know I did, I had a one hour or month or something like that there was on ICT. I never quite know what the value of that that was. So I think he's getting away from it as a subject and actually viewing it much more along the same lines as numeracy literacy. Actually, digital needs to be weaved into every single subject. And it needs to be core to everything. And so I suppose it's that first year getting getting away from as a subject and thinking of it much more as a competency is something that that should be embedded. The second point I'd make, I suppose, is about the breadth of the curriculum. And this is quite sort of quite a wide point I suppose to make just about, I'd say obviously what is the point of GCSE is now given that most young people are all young people stay in educational change at what is the purpose of GCSEs at 16. So, you know, our members of regularly will sort of say to us that they feel that young people are getting a more and more and more narrow curriculum, and how can that be broadened? So one of the questions that were asking at the CBI do regularly ask of government is, is now the right time to start that conversation about rethinking GCSEs entirely about was the point exams, huge amount of pressure and capacity put into 16, but actually mostly stay in to 18 and that that creates the opportunity to have a lot more creativity subjects which have declined over the last 10 years. It also broadens out to help this show be embedded in more and on to the next stage who some amazing analysis done by the Royal Society, about A-Levels over how disadvantaged young people, on average to 2.4 A-Levels to 2.4 subjects. So the idea that a young person by the age of 18 can narrow themselves down to less than three subjects at the age of 18. feels wrong to me. And I think the the changing world of work, globalisation, ai automation requires greater breadth than ever. And yet we're going the opposite direction and actually narrowing down and I I would add on then on to the next stage on to higher education and technical, first and higher education. And I think culturally, and regulatory and pretty much every part of the system and the financial system drives universities to very traditional approaches to higher education. Everything drives towards three year bachelor's degrees. And that's sort of what everyone hopes for that's the sign of success that parents looking for and that's what the finance system encourages. And actually moving away from that and encourage much more flexible, innovative distance digital provision. Now like that of the Open University, I was there only a couple of months ago. And they were showing me they have, they have a free satellite that they can control and they, they, they you can use it as part of education.

On the technical education side and, you know, higher education, I think you'd agree he's put on quite well over the last 10 or 20 years or so. And the part of the system that really is creaking is colleges, further education and adult education. And I think the government and all parties now acknowledge this on the funding side. But actually, we need to make sure that there's the capital investment, so that actually, neither the colleges and FE can invest in technology can invest in the things I just described over Open University in order to actually give a really high level innovative education.
I mean, you mentioned adult education. Do you welcome the government's national retraining scheme?","How might the government's national retraining scheme be affected by changes to GCSEs and A-Levels, and what potential benefits or drawbacks could this have for the future of work and education?","The government's national retraining scheme is designed to upskill and reskill the workforce to meet the changing needs of the economy. Changes to GCSEs and A-Levels could have a significant impact on the scheme's effectiveness. The changes could potentially affect the scheme's ability to provide relevant and effective training for workers, particularly those in certain demographics. Additionally, the changes could impact the scheme's ability to provide training that is tailored to the needs of specific industries and employers.

The potential benefits of changes to GCSEs and A-Levels for the future of work and education include:

* Providing more options for students, allowing them to pursue a wider range of career paths and education choices
* Encouraging students to develop a broader range of skills, including critical thinking, problem-solving, and communication
* Preparing students for the changing nature of work, including the increasing use of automation and artificial intelligence
* Providing a more flexible and adaptable education system that can respond to the changing needs of the economy

However, there are also potential drawbacks to consider, including:

* The potential for changes to GCSEs and A-Levels to increase inequality, particularly if certain students are better equipped to adapt to the changes
* The potential for changes to GCSEs and A-Levels to lead to a lack of relevance and effectiveness in preparing students for the workforce
* The potential for changes to GCSEs and A-Levels to lead to a lack of flexibility and adaptability in the education system, making it difficult to respond to changing economic conditions.

Overall, the impact of changes to GCSEs and A-Levels on the government's national retraining scheme will depend on a range of factors, including the specific changes made, the implementation of the changes, and the response of students, educators, and employers.","['https://www.centreforsocialjustice.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/CSJJ6899-Future-Of-Work-WEB-190215.pdf', 'https://educationhub.blog.gov.uk/2021/10/29/how-does-school-funding-work-and-how-does-the-budget-affect-it/', 'https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5a82c6cb40f0b62305b94499/Social_Mobility_Action_Plan_-_for_printing.pdf', 'https://educationhub.blog.gov.uk/2023/05/18/school-attendance-important-risks-missing-day/', 'https://www.learningatworkweek.com/common/Uploaded%20files/Policy/ReformsRevolutionaryWhitePaper2020.pdf', 'https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sustainability-and-climate-change-strategy/sustainability-and-climate-change-a-strategy-for-the-education-and-childrens-services-systems', 'https://www.cbi.org.uk/media/3841/12546_tess_2019.pdf', 'https://clintonwhitehouse5.archives.gov/WH/Accomplishments/eightyears-03.html', 'https://royalsociety.org/-/media/policy/projects/maths-futures/landscaping-national-mathematics-education-policy.pdf', 'https://www.cbi.org.uk/media/3715/employer-and-lifelong-learning-report.pdf', 'https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-taking-both-GCSEs-and-A-levels-at-once-a-year-early', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/6thForm/comments/vs7q7e/whats_the_actual_advantage_of_4_alevels_over_3/', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8455229/', 'https://www.acs-schools.com/blog/the-latest/news/ib-or-a-levels-which-will-get-you-further/', 'https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2019/637967/EPRS_BRI(2019)637967_EN.pdf', 'https://royalsociety.org/-/media/policy/publications/2023/rs-appg-assessment.pdf', 'https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/clinical-trials-and-studies/clinical-research-benefits-risks-and-safety', 'https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2015/sdn1513.pdf', 'https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/203/education-committee/news/159127/do-post16-qualifications-prepare-young-people-for-the-future-world-of-work/', 'https://ifs.org.uk/inequality/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Education-inequalities.pdf', 'https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-taking-both-GCSEs-and-A-levels-at-once-a-year-early', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/6thForm/comments/vs7q7e/whats_the_actual_advantage_of_4_alevels_over_3/', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8455229/', 'https://www.acs-schools.com/blog/the-latest/news/ib-or-a-levels-which-will-get-you-further/', 'https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2019/637967/EPRS_BRI(2019)637967_EN.pdf', 'https://royalsociety.org/-/media/policy/publications/2023/rs-appg-assessment.pdf', 'https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/clinical-trials-and-studies/clinical-research-benefits-risks-and-safety', 'https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2015/sdn1513.pdf', 'https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/203/education-committee/news/159127/do-post16-qualifications-prepare-young-people-for-the-future-world-of-work/', 'https://ifs.org.uk/inequality/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Education-inequalities.pdf']",education

"Why? I can see the Fear in the decisions our Government and the people have made over the last 100 years… and 500 years.
4th Perspectives have been running this world since the Dark Ages. The Age of Enlightenment (compared to the Dark Ages, it was). 1490’s to 1550’s. 4th Perspectives are still running this world and they are *not* fit for the job.
4th Perspectives do *not* value education. They do not want education. Which is why they keep cutting our programs.
Only the uneducated fail to see the value in education.
When you leave the fate of Quality Education up to the Ignorant and uneducated, they will fail to see the value and integrated importance of Quality Education, and they will fail to provide it for future generations. Intellects, Self-Educators, and Life-Long Learners will reach a point very soon where the Self-Educated will “fire” and Abolish the Self-Deemed “Authorities” in Education for being so grossly inadequate in their own Education, which has lead to their own inability to see, very clearly, the value and need for Quality Education that they so naively can’t see.
And how many teachers are incapable of even answering the one question every student asked? “Why do I have to study this subject?” Not one teacher has ever given the correct answer that I have ever heard. Do you remember asking that question to your teacher when you were in school? How many of them could answer? In my school, not one could answer. Not. One.
Answer : The reason why you have to study math, logic, history, physics, and the sciences is so that you can perceive a multi-faceted Perspective that will allow you to understand your Point of Origin and a wider range of comprehension so you can make educated decisions that take into account catalyst, chain reaction, and consequence to your choices, leading you to a happier life.
The reason why we must study art, music, dance, and theater is to nurture our ability to imagine, which is the fountainhead required for problems solving, authority, autonomy, independent thinking, and thinking “outside of the box.” It is the core of Perspective Shifting so you can view a single topic, problem, or situation from multiple angles.
Math, Physics, and the Sciences help you manage your Logical Health and sharpen your Intuitive Logic so you can better navigate yourself through life resulting in little to no Mental Illness. Leading to Effective Communication so you can transfer and receive information, and so you can make healthy connections and nourish those connections resulting in a strong network and circuit of likeminded individuals.
That is why you have to study these subjects. To gain Perspective, effective communications skills, and the ability to maneuver through and around problems as they arise.
You were taught by a teacher who was so uneducated in their own subject of mastery that they didn’t even know it’s purpose. How much do you trust your own education? How much do you trust your previous educators?
The majority of 3rd and 4th Perspectives don’t want education because they know, intuitively, that this will cause a divide. They know proper education will cause a Schism between Higher Education vs. Lower Education because they logically know, deep down in their gut, that they’ll be “stuck” in the Lower Education bracket. Where they think they will be condemned to doing all the grunt work without the benefit of being in charge… or so they think. They internalize their own actions onto others with the belief that “If someone is smarter than me, then they will make me their slave,” because that is what they would do.
Education is Power. And that is what this is really about. Monopolizing the Power so that those in charge stay in charge. And those without Power stay ignorant and obedient (submissive).
But I know about the Emotional Transactions of Human Connection. It is built on Economics and Physics. I know exactly where Power comes from, how it moves, and how to control Power. I can appreciate how much they don’t want YOU to have this information. Because if you did… Game Over.
Breaking through the class systems has been, for centuries, an impossible task. So much stunted growth, so little faith, so much skepticism. It’s all reflective on how much our Education is lacking. Despite the flood of information, our educated masses are as ignorant as ever. So much so that Masters in Psychology know little to nothing about their own field of Mastery. Which is why so many Psychologists today have Mental Illness, display Narcissism, spent millions of dollars on research for Schizophrenia that left them with absolutely no clue what they are dealing with, oh! But they’re diagnosing it! They’re medicating people for it! Without having a clue what it is (Answer : It’s the Metaphysical Transformation all human people experience between the 6th and 10th Ethical Perspective Stages of Growth).","How might a society that values and prioritizes education and personal growth potentially reshape its economy and social structures to better align with the collective well-being of its citizens, and what potential challenges might arise in doing so?","The societal transformation to prioritize education and personal growth would require a fundamental shift in values and goals, with a focus on creating a more equitable and just society. This could involve rethinking the economy and social structures to prioritize education, healthcare, and social welfare, and to address issues such as poverty, inequality, and climate change.

To achieve this, a society could consider the following strategies:

1. Implementing a universal basic income or a guaranteed minimum income to ensure that all citizens have access to the resources they need to thrive.
2. Investing in education and training programs that focus on developing skills and knowledge that are relevant to the modern economy.
3. Implementing policies that promote social and economic equality, such as progressive taxation, affordable housing, and access to healthcare.
4. Encouraging community engagement and participation in decision-making processes through participatory budgeting and other forms of citizen engagement.
5. Fostering a culture of lifelong learning and personal growth, with a focus on developing skills and knowledge that are relevant to the modern economy.

However, there are also potential challenges to consider:

1. The need for significant changes to the economy and social structures, which could be difficult to implement and may require significant investments of time and resources.
2. The potential for resistance to change from those who benefit from the current system, such as those who hold power and privilege.
3. The need to balance the needs of different groups and individuals, such as those who are most in need of support and those who are already well-off.
4. The potential for unintended consequences, such as the creation of new inequalities or the exacerbation of existing ones.
5. The need for ongoing evaluation and adaptation to ensure that the transformation is effective and sustainable.

Overall, a societal transformation to prioritize education and personal growth would require a fundamental shift in values and goals, with a focus on creating a more equitable and just society. While there are potential challenges to consider, the benefits of such a transformation could be significant, including improved social and economic outcomes, increased happiness and well-being, and a more sustainable and resilient society.","['https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/priority-basic-necessities-pillar-societal-henry-osabutey', 'https://www.globalpartnership.org/what-we-do/how-we-work', 'https://transformschools.ucla.edu/research/rebuilding-more-humane-schools-post-covid-19-prioritizing-student-engagement-social-emotional-learning-and-well-being/', 'https://www.gov.ca.gov/2024/01/10/2024-25-state-budget-proposal-protects-core-priorities-and-ensures-fiscal-stability/', 'https://blogs.worldbank.org/en/education/learning-recovery-education-transformation', 'https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/16/13/5317', 'https://www.aft.org/ae/summer2021/jagers_skoog-hoffman_barthelus_schlund', 'https://admission.ucla.edu/apply/transfer/ucla-transfer-alliance-program', 'https://erasmus-plus.ec.europa.eu/programme-guide/part-a/priorities-of-the-erasmus-programme', 'https://press.un.org/en/2024/dsgsm1913.doc.htm', 'https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/priority-basic-necessities-pillar-societal-henry-osabutey', 'https://medium.com/bits-and-behavior/paulo-freires-pedagogy-of-the-oppressed-a-manifesto-on-education-and-social-change-dbd63cd9fc17', 'https://www.globalpartnership.org/what-we-do/how-we-work', 'https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000378083', 'https://press.un.org/en/2024/dsgsm1913.doc.htm', 'https://unsdg.un.org/latest/blog/costa-rica-un-and-transforming-education-summit-opportunity-reaffirm-education', 'https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2021/05/26/gen-z-millennials-stand-out-for-climate-change-activism-social-media-engagement-with-issue/', 'https://www.cepal.org/en/publications/48519-social-panorama-latin-america-and-caribbean-2022-transforming-education-basis', 'https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43621-021-00058-3', 'https://blogs.worldbank.org/en/education/learning-recovery-education-transformation']",education

Intellects, Self-Educators, and Life-Long Learners will reach a point very soon where the Self-Educated will “fire” and Abolish the Self-Deemed “Authorities” in Education for being so grossly inadequate in their own Education, which has lead to their own inability to see, very clearly, the value and need for Quality Education that they so naively can’t see.
And how many teachers are incapable of even answering the one question every student asked? “Why do I have to study this subject?” Not one teacher has ever given the correct answer that I have ever heard.

Answer : The reason why you have to study math, logic, history, physics, and the sciences is so that you can perceive a multi-faceted Perspective that will allow you to understand your Point of Origin and a wider range of comprehension so you can make educated decisions that take into account catalyst, chain reaction, and consequence to your choices, leading you to a happier life.
The reason why we must study art, music, dance, and theater is to nurture our ability to imagine, which is the fountainhead required for problems solving, authority, autonomy, independent thinking, and thinking “outside of the box.” It is the core of Perspective Shifting so you can view a single topic, problem, or situation from multiple angles.
Math, Physics, and the Sciences help you manage your Logical Health and sharpen your Intuitive Logic so you can better navigate yourself through life resulting in little to no Mental Illness. Leading to Effective Communication so you can transfer and receive information, and so you can make healthy connections and nourish those connections resulting in a strong network and circuit of likeminded individuals.
That is why you have to study these subjects. To gain Perspective, effective communications skills, and the ability to maneuver through and around problems as they arise.

The majority of 3rd and 4th Perspectives don’t want education because they know, intuitively, that this will cause a divide. They know proper education will cause a Schism between Higher Education vs. Lower Education because they logically know, deep down in their gut, that they’ll be “stuck” in the Lower Education bracket. Where they think they will be condemned to doing all the grunt work without the benefit of being in charge… or so they think. They internalize their own actions onto others with the belief that “If someone is smarter than me, then they will make me their slave,” because that is what they would do.
Education is Power. And that is what this is really about. Monopolizing the Power so that those in charge stay in charge. And those without Power stay ignorant and obedient (submissive).

This can be achieved by focusing on the social, economic, and environmental impacts of climate change, rather than the scientific concepts behind it.

The search results show that climate change has various social impacts, including increased poverty, food and water scarcity, and disruptions to society. These impacts can be understood and addressed without requiring in-depth knowledge of astronomy. By focusing on the social, economic, and environmental consequences of climate change, a person can make informed decisions about how to mitigate and adapt to its effects.

For example, understanding the social impacts of climate change can help individuals and communities prepare for and respond to extreme weather events, such as heatwaves and floods. It can also inform policy decisions about how to allocate resources and prioritize investments in areas such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure.

In conclusion, while a person may not have in-depth knowledge of astronomy, they can still make informed decisions about climate change by understanding the broader implications and consequences of climate change.","['https://www.epa.gov/arc-x/implications-climate-change', 'https://climate.ec.europa.eu/climate-change/consequences-climate-change_en', 'https://www.noaa.gov/education/resource-collections/climate/climate-change-impacts', 'https://www.fsb.org/2020/11/the-implications-of-climate-change-for-financial-stability/', 'https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/climate-change-and-health', 'https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/612710/dod-releases-report-on-security-implications-of-climate-change/', 'https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/science/causes-effects-climate-change', 'https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/Newsroom/Reports%20and%20Pubs/Implications_for_US_National_Security_of_Anticipated_Climate_Change.pdf', 'https://science.nasa.gov/climate-change/effects/', 'https://dem.ri.gov/environmental-protection-bureau/water-resources/research-monitoring/impact-climate-change-ri', 'https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/social-dimensions-of-climate-change', 'https://19january2017snapshot.epa.gov/climate-impacts/climate-impacts-society', 'https://www.un.org/esa/desa/papers/2017/wp152_2017.pdf', 'https://www.imperial.ac.uk/grantham/publications/climate-change-faqs/what-are-the-impacts-of-climate-change/', 'https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/science/climate-issues/human-security', 'https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-report-shows-disproportionate-impacts-climate-change-socially-vulnerable', 'https://dec.ny.gov/environmental-protection/climate-change/effects-impacts', 'https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2021-09/climate-vulnerability_september-2021_508.pdf', 'https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/cooling-buildings-sustainably-in-europe', 'https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/climate-change-and-health']",education

These consequences include:

1. Narrowing of the curriculum: Standardized tests often focus on a limited range of subjects, leading to a narrowing of the curriculum and a lack of emphasis on other important subjects such as arts, music, and physical education.

2. Overemphasis on rote memorization: Standardized tests often prioritize rote memorization and recall skills over critical thinking skills, leading to a lack of depth and understanding in students' learning.

3. Increased anxiety and stress: High-stakes testing can lead to increased anxiety and stress levels among students, which can negatively impact their mental health and well-being.

4. Lack of creativity and critical thinking: Standardized tests often do not assess critical thinking and problem-solving skills, leading to a lack of emphasis on these important skills in education.

5. Racial and socioeconomic disparities: Standardized tests can perpetuate racial and socioeconomic disparities in education, as students from disadvantaged backgrounds may not have access to the same resources and support as their more affluent peers.

6. Teacher burnout and demotivation: Standardized testing can lead to teacher burnout and demotivation, as teachers may feel pressured to teach to the test rather than focusing on student learning and development.

7. Limited opportunities for student growth: Standardized tests can limit opportunities for student growth and development, as students may not be given the opportunity to explore their interests and passions outside of the test.

8. Negative impact on student motivation: Standardized tests can have a negative impact on student motivation, as students may feel that their learning is being reduced to a single test score rather than a holistic understanding of their abilities and strengths.

9. Limited opportunities for teacher professional development: Standardized testing can limit opportunities for teacher professional development, as teachers may not have the time or resources to engage in ongoing professional development and training.

10. Negative impact on student self-esteem: Standardized tests can have a negative impact on student self-esteem, as students may feel that their self-worth is tied to a single test score rather than their overall abilities and strengths.

In conclusion, the introduction of a new educational framework that prioritizes standardized testing over critical thinking skills can have a range of unintended consequences on students' long-term development. These consequences can have a negative impact on students' learning, motivation, and overall well-being, and can perpetuate existing inequalities in education.","['https://in.nau.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/135/2018/08/Unintended-Consequences-ek.pdf', 'https://www.ascd.org/el/articles/high-stakes-testing-narrows-the-curriculum', 'https://www.nea.org/nea-today/all-news-articles/racist-beginnings-standardized-testing', 'https://www.edutopia.org/article/psychological-toll-high-stakes-testing/', 'https://news.utexas.edu/2021/04/19/current-system-of-school-testing-in-texas-is-outdated/', 'https://www.graygroupintl.com/blog/standardized-testing', 'https://tcimag.tcia.org/workforce-development/training-wheels-dont-work-a-philosophy-of-training-employees/', 'https://www.edweek.org/education/opinion-response-standardized-test-critiques-potential-alternatives/2011/10', 'https://www.everydaysociologyblog.com/2012/04/cram-memorize-regurgitate-forget.html', 'https://www.eschoolnews.com/innovative-teaching/2023/11/13/standardized-tests-are-pests/', 'https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1337454.pdf', 'https://www.nea.org/nea-today/all-news-articles/standardized-testing-still-failing-students', 'https://www.pennlive.com/opinion/2023/05/too-much-emphasis-on-standardized-tests-can-hurt-creativity-and-critical-thinking-opinion.html', 'https://www.mainepublic.org/maine/2018-06-08/its-not-a-memory-test-education-needs-to-focus-on-critical-thinking', 'https://scholarworks.uno.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&httpsredir=1&article=2688&context=td', 'https://typeset.io/questions/how-does-standardized-testing-impact-deeper-thinking-skills-d3lak3ehkn', 'https://soeonline.american.edu/blog/effects-of-standardized-testing/', 'https://www.graygroupintl.com/blog/standardized-testing', 'https://ectutoring.com/problem-measuring-problem-solving-standardized-tests', 'https://www.ascd.org/el/articles/high-stakes-testing-narrows-the-curriculum']",education

Impaired intuition can lead to difficulties in reading social cues, understanding nonverbal communication, and making informed decisions. This can result in social isolation, difficulties in forming and maintaining relationships, and decreased overall well-being. 

Individuals with impaired intuition may struggle to navigate complex social situations, leading to feelings of anxiety, uncertainty, and confusion. They may also have difficulty understanding the motivations and intentions of others, which can lead to misunderstandings and conflicts. 

Furthermore, impaired intuition can also impact an individual's ability to make informed decisions, as they may rely more heavily on logic and analysis rather than their instincts. This can lead to a lack of spontaneity and creativity, as well as a decreased ability to adapt to changing circumstances. 

In terms of overall logical health and decision-making abilities, impaired intuition can lead to a reliance on rigid thinking patterns and a decreased ability to consider alternative perspectives. This can result in a lack of flexibility and adaptability, as well as a decreased ability to navigate complex and uncertain situations. 

In conclusion, impaired intuition can have significant impacts on an individual's ability to navigate complex relationships and make informed decisions.

Parenting education psychology:

1. Differentiated instruction: This approach involves changing and switching around what students need to learn, how they'll learn it, and how to get the information. This method requires instructional flexibility and can be tailored to individual students' needs.

2. Technology integration: Using technology can help students learn in different ways, such as through multimedia presentations, online resources, and interactive activities.

3. Flexible grouping patterns: Grouping students based on their learning needs can help struggling students receive additional support while allowing advanced students to work on more challenging tasks.

4. Choice and autonomy: Providing students with choices and autonomy can help them feel more engaged and motivated, as they have a sense of control over their learning.

5. Interest-based learning: Integrating student interests into the learning process can help struggling students stay engaged and motivated, as they are learning about topics that are relevant and meaningful to them.

6. Learning style assessment: Identifying students' learning styles and adapting instruction to meet those needs can help struggling students receive the support they need to succeed.

7. Universal Design for Learning (UDL): UDL is an approach that aims to provide multiple means of representation, expression, and engagement for all students, including those who are struggling or exceeding expectations.

8. Formative assessments: Regularly assessing student progress and adjusting instruction accordingly can help teachers identify areas where students need additional support and provide targeted interventions.

9. Parent and community involvement: Involving parents and the community in the learning process can help provide additional support and resources for struggling students, while also providing opportunities for advanced students to engage in extracurricular activities.

10. Professional development: Teachers can benefit from professional development opportunities that focus on differentiated instruction, technology integration, and other strategies for supporting students who are struggling or exceeding expectations.

By considering these strategies, teachers can create a more inclusive and engaging learning environment that meets the diverse needs of all students.","['https://www.learninga-z.com/site/company/what-we-do/differentiated-instruction', 'https://www.understood.org/en/articles/5-common-techniques-for-helping-struggling-students', 'https://www.differentiatedteaching.com/differentiation-for-struggling-readers/', 'https://www.edutopia.org/article/differentiation-challenge-all-students/', 'https://www.readingrockets.org/topics/differentiated-instruction/articles/what-differentiated-instruction', 'https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-differentiate-a-struggling-student', 'https://www.solutiontree.com/blog/differentiated-reading-instruction/', 'https://iris.peabody.vanderbilt.edu/module/di/cresource/q1/p01/', 'https://medium.com/age-of-awareness/differentiated-instruction-not-a-solution-to-student-struggle-yet-8c831e403473', 'https://www.structural-learning.com/post/differentiation-strategies-a-teachers-guide', 'https://www.simplybteaching.com/easy-ways-to-differentiate-instruction/', 'https://community.naceweb.org/blogs/josh-frahm1/2020/01/21/meeting-vs-exceeding-expectationsteaching-students', 'https://www.colorincolorado.org/article/differentiated-instruction-english-language-learners', 'https://www.hmhco.com/blog/strategies-for-differentiated-math-instruction', 'https://www.edutopia.org/blog/differentiated-instruction-myth-too-difficult-john-mccarthy', 'https://www.achieve3000.com/community-resources/achieve-learning/differentiated-virtual-literacy-instruction-students-learning-english-new/', 'https://www.edutopia.org/article/practical-guide-planning-intentional-differentiation/', 'https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED443572', 'https://www.prodigygame.com/main-en/blog/differentiated-instruction-strategies-examples-download/', 'https://www.modelteaching.com/education-articles/teaching-strategies/differentiation-in-the-classroom-content-process-or-product', 'https://www.learninga-z.com/site/company/what-we-do/differentiated-instruction', 'https://www.understood.org/en/articles/5-common-techniques-for-helping-struggling-students', 'https://www.differentiatedteaching.com/differentiation-for-struggling-readers/', 'https://www.edutopia.org/article/differentiation-challenge-all-students/', 'https://www.readingrockets.org/topics/differentiated-instruction/articles/what-differentiated-instruction', 'https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-differentiate-a-struggling-student', 'https://www.solutiontree.com/blog/differentiated-reading-instruction/', 'https://iris.peabody.vanderbilt.edu/module/di/cresource/q1/p01/', 'https://medium.com/age-of-awareness/differentiated-instruction-not-a-solution-to-student-struggle-yet-8c831e403473', 'https://www.structural-learning.com/post/differentiation-strategies-a-teachers-guide']",education

"This is exactly the kind of reaction that indicates kids actually can fall in love with learning. As such, they're the kinds of moments teachers strive to create. In the same way, the large majority of academic assessments ask students for answers. Rarely do we assess students on how well they can ask questions. The ability to ask great questions, however, is a critical skill that is desperately needed in a culture that requires constant innovations.
In the digital age, almost every business employer demands to be skilled at using technology. In the digital age, technology is everywhere. Schools, however, have been slow to adapt to this change. Rarely are students required or taught to learn technology efficiently. This needs to be emphasized.
The skills which create additional values for any individual student. Schools rarely spend time teaching students soft skills, including skills such as time management skills, organizational skills, the ability to look someone in the eyes when talking to them, or using a firm handshake. Most business leaders need this skill in their business places.
This is also an important skill that our teachers should teach the students in the classrooms. As we learn, we acquire new skills and knowledge for various uses. However, none of that knowledge is any good if we don't consider how it has helped us or others. If we are going to place our attention on learning something we must consider the merits of learning it before, during, and after the learning happens. Otherwise, we have engaged in empty learning for no reason. In any kind of learning, asking reflective questions always matters.
Empathy and Perspective Skills
This skill is always important for every student as a human being. The teachers should teach their students the ability to put themselves in someone else's shoes, to understand their feelings, and to help solve their problems. Keeping always a kind attitude to the others of their mates irrespective of all senior and junior individuals.
Therefore, we may ascertain that the above-mentioned skills are the foremost essential skills in the modern education world to overcome future challenges. These skills in fact are the lifelong learning skills that pay to develop the students constantly. Such skills transform our future for the better because they come from what is best in us.
In short, mastering beneficial lifelong learning skills helps us work, learn, and live better. If we desire to establish a golden life for the future generation with quality service to the nation, we have to build up our students with necessary skills that will make their life easier, more comfortable and updated with modern life equipment for the nation.

"And I suppose I would make two points, one about news get a sense of urgency, on fourth industrial revolution, and it's far more complex than we think. And then I'll say a little bit about some of these the four C's, these competencies, skills, frameworks, whatever you want to call them. And so I suppose on the on the first point about the fourth industrial revolution, we need to stop pretending that it's an upcoming event. We're in the fourth Indus revolution is happening, and we keep talking about it like it's sort of about to happen, you know, a lot of the a lot of the impacts of the fourth interest revolution of AI automation and things like that have been happening for a good decade or so. So there is a sense of urgency that we still need to get on this. And that impact of AI and automation is incredibly complex. So everyone's experience of it will be very different. In each sector of the economy, each level, each seniority in a business will be affected very differently. And the one thing that the fourth interest revolution, and kind of is different to previous revolutions that the agrarian and the industrial revolution is their effect all levels of society, the previous industry revolutions tended to impact the low skill and low pay jobs, whereas the fourth revolution is quite as likely to have an impact on what we currently consider to be very high skill, very high paid jobs. So you think about finance, very easy to automate, very easy to use AI and huge swathes of the financial sector. So you know, we can look at the kind of sectors that currently we because it'll be very high paid, very high skilled, actually, they're as vulnerable as drivers. For instance, obviously, the automation of cars would affect. So there's a sense of urgency, the fourth industrial revolution, there's a need to have a nuanced view that will impact all of us in in different ways. And it also needs to be set alongside other challenges that we have. You think about life expectancy as your most favorite statistics that in the last century, for every four hours that past, life expectancy increased by an hour is absolutely astonishing that and that for the entire the last century, that was happening, what that means is that people like me will be working well into their 80s. And if will retire at all. And so the idea that actually we front load education, the idea that we can pour as much education as possible by the age of 18, and 21. If that ever was possible, that idea is certainly dead by now. And then the need to go into lifelong learning is incredibly important. And the second point I was going to make around the sort of frameworks and skills and you have a five pound for every skills framework, I was asked to look at and say just this, will this make the young person work ready, I'd be a very wealthy person. And we did a bit of a literature review of all these frameworks. And you can find about 200 of them. They all use different language, different interpretations, different perspectives on the same thing. And if I'm honest, one of the big problems we have is there are so many of these frameworks, it's deeply confusing for both employers, teachers and young people to actually understand what are the skills that we need? So in order to try and cut through that a little bit, we're at CBI, we set out as a kind of an attempt to answer the question, what does it mean for a young person to work ready? It comes down to three quite simple things. First and foremost is knowledge. There's no escaping that actually knowledge rich curriculum is absolutely vital. All, you know, the too often we slip into Oh, but we've got Google, or you've got all the knowledge the human knows in the phone. Well actually, if you don't know how to start point, you don't know what you're looking for. So actually, we should never forget the importance of knowledge. The second part of what it means to work ready is actually to apply that knowledge in a real world setting. You know, there's no point in knowing how many wives Henry the Eighth had unless, you know, the impact, the reason the the significance of that.

This can be achieved by implementing policies that support job search and skill matching, promoting labor market institutions that support workers, and addressing the root causes of inequality such as lack of digital literacy and age. Additionally, policymakers can also consider implementing policies that support community and economic development programs, and promoting free trade and free markets to create new jobs and higher incomes.

Here are some multiple perspectives and a detailed breakdown:

1. Implementing policies that support job search and skill matching: Policymakers can implement policies that support job search and skill matching, such as providing training programs for workers who are struggling to adapt to changes in the job market. This can help workers develop the skills they need to compete in the modern economy and increase their chances of finding employment.

2. Promoting labor market institutions that support workers: Policymakers can also promote labor market institutions that support workers, such as collective bargaining and minimum wage laws. These institutions can help workers negotiate better wages and working conditions, and provide them with a greater sense of security and stability.

3. Addressing the root causes of inequality: Policymakers can also address the root causes of inequality, such as lack of digital literacy and age. This can be achieved by implementing policies that provide training and education programs for workers who are struggling to adapt to changes in the job market, and by promoting age-friendly workplaces that support workers of all ages.

4. Implementing policies that support community and economic development programs: Policymakers can also implement policies that support community and economic development programs, such as providing funding for local businesses and promoting community development initiatives. This can help create new jobs and stimulate economic growth, and provide workers with greater opportunities for advancement.

5. Promoting free trade and free markets: Finally, policymakers can also promote free trade and free markets to create new jobs and higher incomes. This can be achieved by reducing trade barriers and promoting international trade, and by promoting policies that support entrepreneurship and innovation.

Overall, policymakers can balance the need for economic growth with the need to support individuals who may not be able to adapt to changes in the job market by implementing a combination of policies that address the root causes of inequality and promote inclusive growth.","['https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2015/sdn1513.pdf', 'https://www.epi.org/publication/what-labor-market-changes-have-generated-inequality-and-wage-suppression-employer-power-is-significant-but-largely-constant-whereas-workers-power-has-been-eroded-by-policy-actions/', 'https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2024/01/14/ai-will-transform-the-global-economy-lets-make-sure-it-benefits-humanity', 'https://clintonwhitehouse5.archives.gov/WH/Accomplishments/eightyears-03.html', 'https://gpseducation.oecd.org/revieweducationpolicies/#!node=41761&filter=all', 'https://www.cbo.gov/publication/58946', 'https://www.oecd.org/en/topics/policy-issues/social-policy.html', 'https://www.cbo.gov/publication/59946', 'https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/files/the-fed-explained.pdf', 'https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/nsc/nssall.html', 'https://www.epi.org/publication/what-labor-market-changes-have-generated-inequality-and-wage-suppression-employer-power-is-significant-but-largely-constant-whereas-workers-power-has-been-eroded-by-policy-actions/', 'https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/en/publications/2021/disability-and-labour-market-integration-policy-trends-and-support-eu-member', 'https://www.prisonpolicy.org/blog/2022/02/08/employment/', 'https://www.ppic.org/publication/labor-force-participation-in-california/', 'https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/page/files/20161025_monopsony_labor_mrkt_cea.pdf', 'https://www.ppic.org/publication/priorities-for-californias-economy/', 'https://www.americanprogress.org/article/removing-obstacles-for-disabled-workers-would-strengthen-the-u-s-labor-market/', 'https://www.dol.gov/agencies/odep/program-areas/cie', 'https://siepr.stanford.edu/publications/policy-brief/how-do-tax-policies-affect-individuals-and-businesses', 'https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2015/sdn1513.pdf']",education

"We are working at a moment in history when education is changing. For more than one generation into the 21st century, adults have been trying to figure out how to create schools that reflect the changing society and culture. For those generations, adults have spoken of the need to create “21st century schools.” (I have a former colleague who would recoil every time she heard that phrase. “It’s too late,” she would say, “its going be over before we stop talking about building schools for it.”) These adults have been grounding all of their recommendations in old and outdated assumptions about teaching and learning and technology. Compounding the problems that arise from this is the rate at which everything changes—what we teach, how we teach, and the tools we have for teaching change far more rapidly than they did for previous generations.
What has become clear to me in the time since I began my career in the field, is the schools we need now, and that we will continue to need long after I have retired are will be places where great expertise comes together to create a place that cannot be created by any one individual. Our future schools depend on:

1. **Teach social-emotional learning strategies**: Students who live in poverty can have trouble focusing in school due to external factors. Teaching social-emotional learning strategies can help them develop coping mechanisms and improve their academic performance.

2. **Provide equal academic opportunities**: Schools can address poverty by providing equal academic opportunities to all students, regardless of their socio-economic background. This can include offering extra support to students who need it, such as tutoring or mentorship programs.

3. **Discreetly provide school supplies and snacks**: Providing school supplies and snacks can help alleviate some of the financial burdens that students from low-income families may face. This can include providing free or reduced-cost meals, as well as offering school supplies such as pencils, paper, and backpacks.

4. **Expand early learning**: Expanding early learning programs can help bridge the gap between low-income students and their middle-class peers. This can include providing access to preschool programs, as well as offering summer camps and other enrichment activities.

5. **Invest in education for people of all ages**: Investing in education for people of all ages can help bridge the divide between low-income students and their middle-class peers. This can include providing access to adult education programs, as well as offering training and certification programs for working adults.

6. **Use technology to support students**: Technology can be a powerful tool in supporting students affected by poverty. This can include using digital tools to provide access to educational resources, as well as using technology to provide extra support to students who need it, such as online tutoring or mentorship programs.

7. **Provide parent engagement opportunities**: Providing parent engagement opportunities can help parents from low-income families get involved in their child's education. This can include offering parent-teacher conferences, as well as providing resources and support for parents to help them support their child's education at home.

8. **Address the digital divide**: Addressing the digital divide can help ensure that all students have access to the technology and resources they need to succeed. This can include providing access to computers and internet, as well as offering training and support for students who may not have access to these resources at home.

9. **Use adaptive technologies**: Using adaptive technologies can help provide extra support to students who need it. This can include using technology to provide personalized learning plans, as well as using technology to provide extra support for students who may be struggling with certain concepts.

10. **Provide mental health support**: Providing mental health support can help students affected by poverty cope with the stress and trauma they may be experiencing. This can include providing access to counseling services, as well as offering resources and support for students to help them manage their mental health.

By implementing these strategies, schools can better support students affected by poverty and help them succeed in a digital age.","['https://theartofeducation.edu/2018/09/5-concrete-ways-to-help-students-living-in-poverty/', 'https://www.bushcenter.org/catalyst/poverty/wicks-schools', 'https://www.edutopia.org/blog/what-can-schools-do-to-address-poverty-william-parrett-kathleen-budge', 'https://www.nassp.org/poverty-and-its-impact-on-students-education/', 'https://concernusa.org/news/how-does-education-affect-poverty/', 'https://www.edweek.org/leadership/schools-can-help-make-sure-students-in-poverty-now-dont-grow-up-that-way/2023/09', 'https://www.ascd.org/el/articles/how-poverty-affects-classroom-engagement', 'https://ed.sc.gov/policy/federal-education-programs/office-of-federal-and-state-accountability-trainings/2022-essa-academy/essa-academy-2022-documents/teaching-students-in-poverty-evidence-based-strategies-interventions-that-work/', 'https://www.socialstudies.com/blog/5-ways-teachers-can-address-the-poverty-gap-in-the-classroom/', 'https://www.savethechildren.org/us/charity-organization-children', 'https://malala.org/malalas-story', 'https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/school-discipline/guiding-principles.pdf', 'https://ctu.ieee.org/solutions-to-the-digital-divide-moving-toward-a-more-equitable-future/', 'https://www.worldvision.org/sponsorship-news-stories/global-poverty-facts', 'https://ctu.ieee.org/consequences-of-the-digital-divide-in-education/', 'https://www.unicefusa.org/stories/connecting-protecting-how-unicef-supports-childrens-futures-digital-age', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666412722000137', 'https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/immersive-story/2019/01/22/pass-or-fail-how-can-the-world-do-its-homework', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7973804/', 'https://www.edutopia.org/article/parent-engagement-digital-age/', 'https://malala.org/malalas-story', 'https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/school-discipline/guiding-principles.pdf', 'https://ctu.ieee.org/solutions-to-the-digital-divide-moving-toward-a-more-equitable-future/', 'https://www.worldvision.org/sponsorship-news-stories/global-poverty-facts', 'https://ctu.ieee.org/consequences-of-the-digital-divide-in-education/', 'https://www.unicefusa.org/stories/connecting-protecting-how-unicef-supports-childrens-futures-digital-age', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666412722000137', 'https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/immersive-story/2019/01/22/pass-or-fail-how-can-the-world-do-its-homework', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7973804/', 'https://www.edutopia.org/article/parent-engagement-digital-age/']",education

They can also establish a culture of continuous improvement, where evaluation and assessment are integrated into the innovation process. This can be achieved by:

2. Conducting regular evaluations and assessments of innovation initiatives, using both quantitative and qualitative methods.
3. Providing ongoing professional development and support for teachers and staff, to ensure they have the skills and knowledge needed to implement and evaluate innovative practices.
4. Fostering a culture of collaboration and communication, where teachers, staff, and administrators work together to share ideas, resources, and best practices.
5. Encouraging a growth mindset, where failure is seen as an opportunity for growth and learning, rather than a negative outcome.

"A Glimpse into Karachi’s Educational Landscape
Education is the cornerstone of a thriving society, and it plays a pivotal role in shaping the future of a city. In this article, we will delve into the world of education in Karachi, Pakistan’s largest and most cosmopolitan city. From the historical foundations to the challenges and the bright prospects, we will explore every facet of this vibrant educational landscape.
Karachi, often referred to as the “City of Lights,” is not only the economic hub of Pakistan but also a melting pot of diverse cultures, traditions, and ideas. As such, its educational sector reflects this diversity, offering a plethora of options to its residents.
The Early Beginnings
Education in Karachi dates back to the pre-independence era when schools were established by the British colonial rulers. These schools laid the foundation for the city’s educational system, which has since evolved and expanded.
After Pakistan’s independence in 1947, Karachi continued to grow, attracting people from various parts of the country. This influx led to an increased demand for education, and the city’s education system expanded to accommodate a rapidly growing population.
The Prestigious Universities
Karachi is home to several prestigious universities, including the University of Karachi, Aga Khan University, and Karachi Institute of Economics and Technology (KIET). These institutions offer a wide range of academic programs, attracting students from all over the country.
Schools and Colleges
The city boasts a plethora of schools and colleges, both public and private. A few notable examples include the Karachi Grammar School, St. Patrick’s High School, and the Dow Medical College. These institutions have a rich history of producing successful graduates who have contributed significantly to various fields.
Challenges in Education
Accessibility and Affordability
Despite the city’s educational diversity, accessibility to quality education remains a significant challenge for many residents. The cost of education in private institutions can be prohibitive for some, and public schools often face resource constraints.
Quality of Education
Maintaining high standards of education is another concern. While prestigious institutions offer world-class education, many others struggle to meet the required benchmarks.
Initiatives and Reforms
The government of Sindh, where Karachi is located, has launched various initiatives to improve the education sector. These include scholarship programs, teacher training, and infrastructure development.
Role of Non-Governmental Organizations
NGOs and philanthropic organizations are actively working to bridge the educational gap by providing scholarships, teacher training, and creating learning opportunities for marginalized communities.
The Future of Education in Karachi
Karachi is embracing technology in education, with an increasing number of schools and universities offering online courses and digital resources. This shift has the potential to make education more accessible.
Entrepreneurship and Skill Development
The city is also witnessing a rise in entrepreneurship and skill development programs, catering to the demands of a rapidly changing job market.

"A Glimpse into Karachi’s Educational Landscape
Education is the cornerstone of a thriving society, and it plays a pivotal role in shaping the future of a city. In this article, we will delve into the world of education in Karachi, Pakistan’s largest and most cosmopolitan city. From the historical foundations to the challenges and the bright prospects, we will explore every facet of this vibrant educational landscape.
Karachi, often referred to as the “City of Lights,” is not only the economic hub of Pakistan but also a melting pot of diverse cultures, traditions, and ideas. As such, its educational sector reflects this diversity, offering a plethora of options to its residents.
The Early Beginnings
Education in Karachi dates back to the pre-independence era when schools were established by the British colonial rulers. These schools laid the foundation for the city’s educational system, which has since evolved and expanded.
After Pakistan’s independence in 1947, Karachi continued to grow, attracting people from various parts of the country. This influx led to an increased demand for education, and the city’s education system expanded to accommodate a rapidly growing population.

Challenges in Education
Accessibility and Affordability
Despite the city’s educational diversity, accessibility to quality education remains a significant challenge for many residents. The cost of education in private institutions can be prohibitive for some, and public schools often face resource constraints.
Quality of Education
Maintaining high standards of education is another concern. While prestigious institutions offer world-class education, many others struggle to meet the required benchmarks.
Initiatives and Reforms
The government of Sindh, where Karachi is located, has launched various initiatives to improve the education sector. These include scholarship programs, teacher training, and infrastructure development.
Role of Non-Governmental Organizations
NGOs and philanthropic organizations are actively working to bridge the educational gap by providing scholarships, teacher training, and creating learning opportunities for marginalized communities.

"The only way this can be done effectively is with good communication. Having communication skills means less stress, more productivity, and better relationships. Future employers need to be able to communicate with people within their team, as well as people outside of the team and organization.
Working in groups is a hallmark of the digital age. Our classrooms and businesses incorporate teamwork into their daily practices and also foster a culture of competition and independence rather than one of teamwork and collaboration. As such, collaborative abilities have a permanent place among the most beneficial lifelong learning skills all students should develop. Future employers will need to quickly adapt to a culture of collaboration. They will need to collaborate with others within and outside of the organization, often using a number of new technologies.
This means being able to work in groups that are both physical and virtual. It includes proficiency in communication, empathy, and leadership values. It also means being able to work with someone across the world as easily and productively as someone across the room. This is why Collaboration skill is one of the Essential Skills being taught in classrooms all over the world.
Leaders are an asset in any classroom and in every workforce. Anyone whose attitude moves from “I can do it” to “we can do it” makes everybody better. It's their independence and willingness to take responsibility for making good things happen, not just simply getting things done. That's why leaders see more, do more, and learn more.
Understanding leadership is one of those beneficial lifelong learning skills that can change people's lives. After all, one who leads isn't just one who manages things. What a leader does is inspire, motivate, and empower. True leaders see the best in people and teach them to harness their potential in all they do.
Problem Solving Skills
The world is changing and will continue changing dramatically. As such our children will be solving future problems that we can't even imagine yet. They'll face challenges that require skills to define a problem, design an appropriate solution, and put it to effective use.
Problem-solving skills help them tackle anything from writing a shopping list to designing and realizing their biggest dreams. As far as beneficial lifelong learning skills go, this one is probably the most important. Solving real-world problems with a process like Solution Fluency is crucial to surviving and thriving in the present and future.
Critical Thinking Skills
The way we think about the world, ourselves and each other affects more than just personal experience. It has a part in defining the future of everything and everyone and the entire world—this is the “Ripple Effect.” It's been a part of many cultural philosophies for thousands of years, reminding us that how we choose to think and act influences our whole world. We don't have to be overwhelmed by it, just simply aware of it as it guides our critical thinking practices.
There is a decreased emphasis on employers following directions and an increased emphasis on employers thinking critically and solving problems. In a rapidly changing world, employers need employees who can solve problems, provide ideas and help improve the organization. The ability to think critically is a must for future success in a changing world. It's about thinking independently, responsibly, and productively. In fact, one of the best definitions of critical thinking can be found on the Critical Thinking Web. The latest term is used in thinking skills as ‘Internet of Thinking' (IoT).
Information Management Skills
Dealing with information means we can determine what is valuable and discard what is spurious or questionable. This is important for producing solutions and products that are genuine and useful. It's also an aspect of research and proper attribution of sources, things every good digital citizen needs to know. Information is essentially all things on the Internet, and it's alive and growing.
Personal Management Skills
Personal management is one of the basic skills to overcome future challenges. This includes the ability for employers to independently plan, organize, create and execute, rather than wait for someone to do this for them.
Curiosity and Inquiry Skills
Without curiosity and inquiry skills there is no learning effectively. Lifelong learning is driven by curiosity.

Our classrooms and businesses incorporate teamwork into their daily practices and also foster a culture of competition and independence rather than one of teamwork and collaboration. As such, collaborative abilities have a permanent place among the most beneficial lifelong learning skills all students should develop. Future employers will need to quickly adapt to a culture of collaboration. They will need to collaborate with others within and outside of the organization, often using a number of new technologies.
This means being able to work in groups that are both physical and virtual. It includes proficiency in communication, empathy, and leadership values. It also means being able to work with someone across the world as easily and productively as someone across the room. This is why Collaboration skill is one of the Essential Skills being taught in classrooms all over the world.
Leaders are an asset in any classroom and in every workforce. Anyone whose attitude moves from “I can do it” to “we can do it” makes everybody better. It's their independence and willingness to take responsibility for making good things happen, not just simply getting things done. That's why leaders see more, do more, and learn more.
Understanding leadership is one of those beneficial lifelong learning skills that can change people's lives. After all, one who leads isn't just one who manages things.

In a rapidly changing world, employers need employees who can solve problems, provide ideas and help improve the organization.

Here are some strategies that can be employed:

1. Prioritize tasks effectively: Identify the most critical tasks and focus on those first. Use tools such as the Eisenhower Matrix to categorize tasks into urgent vs. important and focus on the most critical ones first.

2. Delegate tasks: Identify tasks that can be delegated to team members and provide clear instructions and deadlines. This can help to reduce the workload on the team leader and free up time for more strategic tasks.

3. Communicate effectively: Communicate clearly and regularly with stakeholders to ensure that everyone is aware of priorities and deadlines. Use tools such as project management software to track progress and provide updates.

4. Manage competing priorities: Identify competing priorities and prioritize them based on their importance and urgency. Use tools such as the Pareto principle to identify the most critical tasks and focus on those first.

5. Cultivate a culture of continuous learning: Encourage team members to learn from past experiences and share knowledge and best practices. This can help to improve team performance and reduce the risk of conflicts.

6. Make it a team effort: Involve team members in the decision-making process and encourage them to take ownership of their tasks. This can help to build trust and improve team morale.

7. Develop a whole new skillset: Develop skills such as coaching, communication, and strategic thinking to effectively manage competing priorities and conflicting demands.

8. Manage workload: Use workload management strategies such as task list prioritization, time blocking, and delegation to manage workload and reduce stress.

9. Prioritize self-care: Prioritize self-care and maintain a healthy work-life balance by setting boundaries, taking breaks, and engaging in activities that bring joy and fulfillment.

10. Seek support: Seek support from colleagues, mentors, or coaches to help manage competing priorities and conflicting demands.","['https://www.mural.co/blog/manage-competing-priorities', 'https://letsgrowleaders.com/2020/10/01/what-leaders-do-with-a-clash-in-priorities/', 'https://www.walkme.com/blog/competing-priorities/', 'https://uk.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/conflicting-priorities-interview-question', 'https://leaderchat.org/2017/04/08/unclear-direction-competing-priorities-ask-madeleine/', 'https://azzarellogroup.com/web/changing-and-conflicting-priorities/', 'https://www.nursingworld.org/content-hub/resources/nursing-leadership/conflict-resolution-in-nursing/', 'https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2021/08/24/13-leaders-tips-for-tackling-a-long-list-of-competing-priorities/', 'https://www.astrazeneca.com/content/dam/az/PDF/2020/covid-19-toolkit/Managing_Conflicting_Priorities.pdf', 'https://medium.com/engineering-managers-journal/engineering-manager-skills-101-communication-delegation-strategy-723277e1ceec', 'https://www.preplounge.com/en/consulting-forum/give-me-an-example-of-a-time-that-you-have-led-a-group-to-achieve-a-difficult-goal-4825', 'https://hypercontext.com/blog/management-skills/how-to-prioritize-tasks', 'https://www.linkedin.com/advice/0/what-most-effective-ways-leaders-prioritize-tasks-meet-xu5ec', 'https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/how-to-delegate-effectively', 'https://www.teamwork.com/blog/how-to-prioritize-tasks/', 'https://workplace.stackexchange.com/questions/189743/how-to-deal-with-team-members-who-do-not-prioritize-work-related-tasks', 'https://www.liquidplanner.com/blog/how-to-prioritize-work-when-everythings-1/', 'https://asana.com/resources/effectively-manage-team-workload', 'https://hbr.org/2019/03/as-your-team-gets-bigger-your-leadership-style-has-to-adapt', 'https://asana.com/resources/how-to-delegate', 'https://www.mural.co/blog/manage-competing-priorities', 'https://letsgrowleaders.com/2020/10/01/what-leaders-do-with-a-clash-in-priorities/', 'https://www.walkme.com/blog/competing-priorities/', 'https://uk.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/conflicting-priorities-interview-question', 'https://leaderchat.org/2017/04/08/unclear-direction-competing-priorities-ask-madeleine/', 'https://azzarellogroup.com/web/changing-and-conflicting-priorities/', 'https://www.nursingworld.org/content-hub/resources/nursing-leadership/conflict-resolution-in-nursing/', 'https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2021/08/24/13-leaders-tips-for-tackling-a-long-list-of-competing-priorities/', 'https://www.astrazeneca.com/content/dam/az/PDF/2020/covid-19-toolkit/Managing_Conflicting_Priorities.pdf', 'https://medium.com/engineering-managers-journal/engineering-manager-skills-101-communication-delegation-strategy-723277e1ceec']",education

"Many online courses offer certifications or credits toward a degree program. These programs are often accredited by educational authorities, ensuring that they meet specific quality standards.
Accredited programs are particularly important for students who wish to use their online coursework for professional advancement or further education.
- Certificate Programs: These are short-term courses focusing on a specific skill or field of study.
- Bachelor’s and Master’s Degree Programs: Many universities now offer full degree programs online in various fields. These programs are similar to their on-campus counterparts in terms of curriculum and accreditation.
- Professional Development Courses: Targeted at working professionals, these courses often focus on skill enhancement and are aligned with industry standards.
Online courses offer a flexible, diverse learning environment, catering to a broad target audience. From the way students interact with instructors and peers to the type of accreditations available, online education provides numerous opportunities for personal and professional growth.
Whether enrolled in a similar course for skill enhancement or a full-fledged degree program, e-learning has something to offer for every learner.
Benefits of Online Courses
Convenience and Flexibility
The most significant advantage of online courses is their convenience. Learners can study at their own pace and own time, fitting their education around other life commitments. This flexibility makes learning more accessible to a wider audience.
Wide Range of Topics and Skills
Online courses cover an extensive range of subjects, from academic topics to practical skills and personal hobbies. This variety means that there’s a course for almost every interest and professional need.
Networking and Global Reach
Online learning connects students from around the world, creating a diverse learning community. This global network offers unique perspectives and networking opportunities.
Challenges of Online Learning
While online courses offer numerous benefits, they come with their own set of challenges. Staying motivated in a self-paced environment, managing time effectively, and the lack of physical interaction can be difficult for some learners. However, with the right approach and mindset, these challenges can be overcome.
The Future of Online Courses
The world of online education is continuously evolving. With advancements in technology and instructional design, online courses are becoming more sophisticated and interactive. They are a viable alternative to traditional education, offering flexibility, accessibility, and a diverse range of learning opportunities.
Embracing the Digital Revolution in Education
As we embrace this digital revolution in education, it’s clear that online courses will continue to play a significant role in lifelong learning and professional development. They offer a unique opportunity for individuals to learn new skills, advance their careers, and explore new interests, all on their own terms.
Conclusion: Your Gateway to a World of Knowledge
In conclusion, online courses represent a significant shift in the educational landscape, offering unprecedented flexibility, accessibility, and personalization in learning. The traditional boundaries of classrooms have been expanded, if not entirely dissolved, by the digital revolution, enabling learners worldwide to access a vast array of knowledge and skills at their convenience. This shift has not only democratized education but also tailored it to fit the needs and lifestyles of modern learners.
The future of learning through online courses is bright and full of potential. With advancements in technology, we are witnessing a continual enhancement in the quality and interactivity of online education.
Virtual reality, artificial intelligence, and adaptive learning algorithms are just some of the innovations that are beginning to play a role in online learning, promising even more immersive and personalized educational experiences. The integration of these technologies is not just a possibility but an inevitability in the evolution of online education.
In essence, online courses have put the future of learning into the hands of the learners themselves. They have opened up a world where education is no longer confined by geographical, financial, or temporal barriers. As we continue to embrace and improve this mode of learning, we move closer to a world where anyone, anywhere, can learn anything at any time – a truly revolutionary notion.

"Digital technologies are making a huge impact on our daily lives. We can already witness a number of effects of Internet on social life, but the influence of IT tools and programs spreads way beyond that.
Education is one of the fields that experience the most significant changes. According to the research, eLearning increases retention rates by 25% to 60%, which is the main reason why the global market is growing rapidly and projected to be worth $325 billion by 2025.
Online learning technologies are improving education in many different ways and getting increasingly popular among students and business professionals all over the world. Now, the key question is: How can online platforms change the way we learn in 2020?
We prepared a whole list of answers for you, so keep reading to see 10 ways digital technologies are going to enhance learning next year!
Online platforms encourage interactions
We begin with a feature that benefits and augments traditional learning practices in particular. Namely, online platforms enhance classroom-based studying and take it outside schools and colleges by encouraging social interactions between students and teachers.
For example, a professor can quickly create a Facebook group and invite his/her students to join the community. They can use the group to share ideas, upload documents, discuss classroom topics, exchange learning materials, and many more.
This is also the way to promote interactions among peers and help them break social barriers through online conversations.
Education becomes globally accessible
Unlike traditional learning, online education is globally accessible. How come? The idea is simple – all it takes is a stable Internet connection to gain access to various learning resources. A report reveals that almost four billion people use the Internet on a global scale.
In other words, more than half of the world’s population is able to find and use online studying tools at any given moment. This makes eLearning an unprecedented phenomenon that drastically changes the entire education market. Such a high level of accessibility can help people all over the world to begin studying and increasing the odds of making a career breakthrough.
Besides that, online learning is not time-bound as there are no plans, schedules, and calendars. It means that students can learn their lessons whenever they choose to.
A growing number of learning resources
The Internet is literally endless, so the only logical conclusion is that it can gradually build an all-encompassing library of learning resources. Of course, it will take years or even decades to systemize and categorize online studying resources, but it’s clear that the concept itself is incredibly powerful.
You don’t have to go beyond Wikipedia to understand the effect of online platforms on education. Although not perfect, Wikipedia already gives comprehensive and accurate answers to many questions and makes the studying process faster and simpler. There are also millions of other resources, including digital courses, eBooks, webinars, etc.
Free learning resources
This feature goes hand in hand with the previous one. Namely, the Internet is packed with learning resources that are not only valuable but also free of charge. We already mentioned Wikipedia as one example, but there many other platforms to check out. Some of the best free resources are:
- Project Gutenberg: If you are interested in free eBooks, this platform will give you over 60 thousand options.
- YouTube EDU: Video learning fans can find amazing materials on YouTube EDU.
- Udemy: You can find a plethora of free courses on Udemy.
Online learning assistance programs
The days when students had to do all the work on their own are long gone. Today, the Internet is offering you dozens of high-quality learning assistance programs. Using their services, you can plan and write school or college papers in a matter of hours.
The only problem is how to choose the best platforms from a wide range of more or less similar services, but we can give you a hand by pointing out proven solutions in the field. In our experience, the best content creation platforms are essay writing service, uk-dissertation.com, and essay writing help.
Imagine how great it would be to have the option of personalizing your learning experiences. As it turns out, you don’t have to dream about it anymore because eLearning makes it possible to customize your studies and make it fit your learning style exclusively.
Most tools have powerful analytics and so they can predict your needs, learning style, and pace. In such circumstances, you can enjoy the privilege of individualized learning and keep the rhythm that suits your requirements.

Unlike traditional learning, online education is globally accessible. How come? The idea is simple – all it takes is a stable Internet connection to gain access to various learning resources. A report reveals that almost four billion people use the Internet on a global scale.
In other words, more than half of the world’s population is able to find and use online studying tools at any given moment. This makes eLearning an unprecedented phenomenon that drastically changes the entire education market. Such a high level of accessibility can help people all over the world to begin studying and increasing the odds of making a career breakthrough.
Besides that, online learning is not time-bound as there are no plans, schedules, and calendars. It means that students can learn their lessons whenever they choose to.
A growing number of learning resources
The Internet is literally endless, so the only logical conclusion is that it can gradually build an all-encompassing library of learning resources. Of course, it will take years or even decades to systemize and categorize online studying resources, but it’s clear that the concept itself is incredibly powerful.
You don’t have to go beyond Wikipedia to understand the effect of online platforms on education. Although not perfect, Wikipedia already gives comprehensive and accurate answers to many questions and makes the studying process faster and simpler. There are also millions of other resources, including digital courses, eBooks, webinars, etc.
Free learning resources
This feature goes hand in hand with the previous one. Namely, the Internet is packed with learning resources that are not only valuable but also free of charge. We already mentioned Wikipedia as one example, but there many other platforms to check out. Some of the best free resources are:
- Project Gutenberg: If you are interested in free eBooks, this platform will give you over 60 thousand options.
- YouTube EDU: Video learning fans can find amazing materials on YouTube EDU.
- Udemy: You can find a plethora of free courses on Udemy.
Online learning assistance programs
The days when students had to do all the work on their own are long gone. Today, the Internet is offering you dozens of high-quality learning assistance programs. Using their services, you can plan and write school or college papers in a matter of hours.
The only problem is how to choose the best platforms from a wide range of more or less similar services, but we can give you a hand by pointing out proven solutions in the field. In our experience, the best content creation platforms are essay writing service, uk-dissertation.com, and essay writing help.
Imagine how great it would be to have the option of personalizing your learning experiences. As it turns out, you don’t have to dream about it anymore because eLearning makes it possible to customize your studies and make it fit your learning style exclusively.
Most tools have powerful analytics and so they can predict your needs, learning style, and pace. In such circumstances, you can enjoy the privilege of individualized learning and keep the rhythm that suits your requirements.
Gamification in eLearning
The personalization of eLearning is one thing, but gamification is yet another feature that makes the process so precious. Game-like elements make students more interested and engaged, which drastically increases retention rates.","What are some effective ways to incorporate storytelling into the learning process to increase student engagement and motivation, and how can online platforms facilitate the use of story-based learning?","To effectively incorporate storytelling into the learning process, we need to consider multiple perspectives and strategies to increase student engagement and motivation.","['https://elearningindustry.com/7-tips-integrate-storytelling-next-elearning-course', 'https://www.lucalampariello.com/storytelling-learn-languages/', 'https://www.yoremikids.com/news/storytelling-benefits-child-development', 'https://www.teachforamerica.org/stories/how-to-incorporate-social-emotional-learning-in-your-classroom', 'https://www.edutopia.org/blog/storytelling-inspires-children-learn-english-matthew-friday', 'https://www.harvardbusiness.org/what-makes-storytelling-so-effective-for-learning/', 'https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-language-learning-adventure-how-short-stories-krystyna-trushyna-ix27f', 'https://urbanedjournal.gse.upenn.edu/volume-16-issue-1-spring-2019/personal-story-sharing-engagement-strategy-promote-student-learning', 'https://vhlblog.vistahigherlearning.com/twelve-ways-to-integrate-storytelling-in-the-classroom.html', 'https://www.edutopia.org/blog/storytelling-in-the-classroom-matters-matthew-friday', 'https://elearningindustry.com/storytelling-in-online-learning-useful-tips', 'https://kwiga.com/blog/what-is-storytelling-and-how-to-use-it-to-create-online-courses', 'https://edly.io/blog/the-importance-of-storytelling-in-online-education/', 'https://learningpool.com/en-us/blog/7-creative-ways-to-incorporate-storytelling-in-compliance-online-training/', 'https://www.ldonline.org/your-stories/personal-stories/how-reading-and-writing-have-shaped-my-life', 'https://learn.arcgis.com/en/projects/share-the-story-of-an-expedition/', 'https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-become-online-course-creator-my-story-micala-quinn', 'https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/data-storytelling', 'https://www.thinglink.com/blog/what-is-digital-storytelling-and-how-to-use-it-in-the-most-powerful-way/', 'https://www.unthsc.edu/academic-innovation/events/olc-webinar-tell-me-your-story-building-engagement-and-inclusion-in-online-and-hybrid-courses-with-digital-storytelling-methods/', 'https://elearningindustry.com/storytelling-in-online-learning-useful-tips', 'https://kwiga.com/blog/what-is-storytelling-and-how-to-use-it-to-create-online-courses', 'https://edly.io/blog/the-importance-of-storytelling-in-online-education/', 'https://learningpool.com/en-us/blog/7-creative-ways-to-incorporate-storytelling-in-compliance-online-training/', 'https://www.ldonline.org/your-stories/personal-stories/how-reading-and-writing-have-shaped-my-life', 'https://learn.arcgis.com/en/projects/share-the-story-of-an-expedition/', 'https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-become-online-course-creator-my-story-micala-quinn', 'https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/data-storytelling', 'https://www.thinglink.com/blog/what-is-digital-storytelling-and-how-to-use-it-in-the-most-powerful-way/', 'https://www.unthsc.edu/academic-innovation/events/olc-webinar-tell-me-your-story-building-engagement-and-inclusion-in-online-and-hybrid-courses-with-digital-storytelling-methods/']",education

b. Describe the dependency of the human being on the other three orders.","Can you explain how the lack of a clear moral compass can lead to a sense of disorientation in individuals, ultimately affecting their ability to make decisions that align with their values and goals?","The lack of a clear moral compass can lead to a sense of disorientation in individuals, ultimately affecting their ability to make decisions that align with their values and goals. This disorientation can manifest in various ways, such as feelings of guilt or shame, moral conflict, and a loss of confidence in one's moral judgment. As a result, individuals may struggle to make decisions that align with their values and goals, leading to a sense of uncertainty and confusion.

The consequences of moral disorientation can be far-reaching and devastating, affecting not only an individual's decision-making abilities but also their overall well-being and relationships. For instance, moral disorientation can lead to feelings of anxiety, depression, and even suicidal thoughts. It can also impact an individual's ability to form and maintain meaningful relationships, as they may struggle to communicate their values and goals effectively.

In terms of decision making, moral disorientation can lead to a lack of clarity and direction, making it difficult for individuals to make decisions that align with their values and goals. This can result in feelings of indecision, uncertainty, and confusion, which can be overwhelming and debilitating.

To mitigate the effects of moral disorientation, it is essential to develop a clear moral compass that guides decision making. This can involve reflecting on one's values and goals, seeking guidance from trusted individuals or resources, and engaging in open and honest communication with others. By developing a clear moral compass, individuals can regain a sense of direction and purpose, enabling them to make decisions that align with their values and goals.","['https://encyclopedia.pub/entry/53654', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6506903/', 'https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/169436/ncassado.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8366182/', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_injury', 'https://www.popefrancisgeneration.com/p/marcus-mescher-moral-injury-and-clerical', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/28/opinion/art-morality-discomfort.html', 'https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/04/05/why-animals-dont-get-lost', 'https://compass.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/lic3.12694', 'https://nautil.us/the-dark-side-of-awe-503557/', 'https://philarchive.org/rec/HIGSDM', 'https://www.jstor.org/stable/23254903', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7363015/', 'https://www.bma.org.uk/media/4209/bma-moral-distress-injury-survey-report-june-2021.pdf', 'https://academic.oup.com/book/11839/chapter/160934902', 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36780060/', 'https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10677-020-10113-z', 'https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/169436/ncassado.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y', 'https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-40939-002', 'https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0969733020966776', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7363015/', 'https://medicine.missouri.edu/centers-institutes-labs/health-ethics/faq/advance-directives', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7452612/', 'https://www.bma.org.uk/media/4209/bma-moral-distress-injury-survey-report-june-2021.pdf', 'https://ojs.lib.uwo.ca/index.php/fpq/article/download/3485/2735/6158', 'https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/ama-code-medical-ethics-opinions-patient-decision-making-capacity-and-competence-and-surrogate/2017-07', 'https://ojs.lib.uwo.ca/index.php/fpq/article/view/3485?articlesBySimilarityPage=5', 'https://poj.peeters-leuven.be/content.php?url=article&id=3289019', 'https://academic.oup.com/book/11839/chapter/160935470', 'https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/advance-care-planning/advance-care-planning-advance-directives-health-care']",education

b. Describe the dependency of the human being on the other three orders.","Can you describe a scenario where a person's lack of understanding of human values leads to a breakdown in communication with their family members, resulting in a sense of disconnection and isolation?","The final answer is:

Here is the detailed scenario:

Meet Sarah, a 35-year-old marketing professional who has been struggling to connect with her family members. She has always been focused on her career and has never really taken the time to understand her family's values and beliefs. As a result, she often finds herself at odds with her family members, who have different views on various topics.

One day, Sarah's mother, who is a strong advocate for environmental conservation, becomes upset with Sarah's decision to buy a new car that has a high carbon footprint. Sarah, who is more concerned with her career and financial stability, doesn't understand why her mother is so upset and feels that her mother is being too critical. The conversation quickly escalates into a heated argument, with both parties feeling unheard and misunderstood.

As the days go by, the tension between Sarah and her mother continues to grow. Sarah's mother feels that Sarah is not taking her values and beliefs seriously, while Sarah feels that her mother is being too judgmental and critical. The lack of understanding and respect for each other's perspectives leads to a breakdown in communication, and the two begin to feel disconnected and isolated from each other.

The scenario illustrates how a person's lack of understanding of human values can lead to a breakdown in communication with their family members, resulting in a sense of disconnection and isolation.","['https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023626/', 'https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/family-conflict', 'https://www.preplounge.com/en/consulting-forum/give-me-an-example-of-a-time-that-you-have-led-a-group-to-achieve-a-difficult-goal-4825', 'https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/trauma-and-families', 'https://www.yourthoughtpartner.com/blog/poor-communication-in-the-workplace', 'https://training.fema.gov/emiweb/is/is242b/student%20manual/sm_03.pdf', 'https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.13016', 'https://milnepublishing.geneseo.edu/interpersonalcommunication/chapter/9/', 'https://www.simpplr.com/blog/2021/causes-effects-poor-communication-workplace/', 'https://www.faasafety.gov/files/gslac/courses/content/258/1097/AMT_Handbook_Addendum_Human_Factors.pdf', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023626/', 'https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/family-conflict', 'https://www.preplounge.com/en/consulting-forum/give-me-an-example-of-a-time-that-you-have-led-a-group-to-achieve-a-difficult-goal-4825', 'https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/trauma-and-families', 'https://www.yourthoughtpartner.com/blog/poor-communication-in-the-workplace', 'https://training.fema.gov/emiweb/is/is242b/student%20manual/sm_03.pdf', 'https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.13016', 'https://milnepublishing.geneseo.edu/interpersonalcommunication/chapter/9/', 'https://www.simpplr.com/blog/2021/causes-effects-poor-communication-workplace/', 'https://www.faasafety.gov/files/gslac/courses/content/258/1097/AMT_Handbook_Addendum_Human_Factors.pdf', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023626/', 'https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/family-conflict', 'https://www.preplounge.com/en/consulting-forum/give-me-an-example-of-a-time-that-you-have-led-a-group-to-achieve-a-difficult-goal-4825', 'https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/trauma-and-families', 'https://www.yourthoughtpartner.com/blog/poor-communication-in-the-workplace', 'https://training.fema.gov/emiweb/is/is242b/student%20manual/sm_03.pdf', 'https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.13016', 'https://milnepublishing.geneseo.edu/interpersonalcommunication/chapter/9/', 'https://www.simpplr.com/blog/2021/causes-effects-poor-communication-workplace/', 'https://www.faasafety.gov/files/gslac/courses/content/258/1097/AMT_Handbook_Addendum_Human_Factors.pdf', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023626/', 'https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/family-conflict', 'https://www.preplounge.com/en/consulting-forum/give-me-an-example-of-a-time-that-you-have-led-a-group-to-achieve-a-difficult-goal-4825', 'https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/trauma-and-families', 'https://www.yourthoughtpartner.com/blog/poor-communication-in-the-workplace', 'https://training.fema.gov/emiweb/is/is242b/student%20manual/sm_03.pdf', 'https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.13016', 'https://milnepublishing.geneseo.edu/interpersonalcommunication/chapter/9/', 'https://www.simpplr.com/blog/2021/causes-effects-poor-communication-workplace/', 'https://www.faasafety.gov/files/gslac/courses/content/258/1097/AMT_Handbook_Addendum_Human_Factors.pdf']",education
"8. The body’s mode of interaction is only recognition and fulfillment.
9. The self is a conscious entity, whereas the body is a material entity with physicochemical properties.
10. The needs and activities of the body and the self are quite different and must be understood as such. However, these two components of the human being must work in tandem.
3. a. Define affection. How does affection lead to harmony in the family?
Ans. A. Affection:
- Affection is the feeling of being connected to another.
- Affection arises when I recognize that we both want to make each other happy and that we are similar.
- Then, for the first time, I feel connected to the other, as if the other is a relative of mine. This is known as affection.
- Only when trust and respect are established can affection be felt. 5. Without trust and respect, we believe the other is out to hurt us, and doesn’t care about us, and as a result, we are unable to feel affection for them. We consistently perceive the other as being opposed.
B. Affection leads to Harmony in the family in the following ways:
- Love and affection within the family are crucial for harmony and healthy development.
- It is the deep affection that drives parents to make sacrifices for their children’s upbringing, household activities, and financial needs.
- Without the affection factor, no one would have lived solely for the sake of the family.
- Parents are obligated to take care of their children, and children are obligated to love and obey their parents.
- It is critical to constantly nurture affection in the family in order to keep the bond of love between family members strong.
- It is the unrivaled affection that fosters a sense of belonging in family life.
- The affection expressed within the family is a commitment to the family, not benevolence.
- Verbal expressions of affection, quality time spent with family, gifts, mutual services, affectionate touch, and labour love touch, among other things, are the most recommended modes of nurturing affection in the family between family members for the growth of harmony.
b. What is the building block for harmony in the society?
Ans. Right understanding in the individuals is the basis for harmony in the family, which is the building block for harmony in the society.
- The foundation of social harmony is the person. As the cornerstone of social harmony, we must ensure that each individual has the proper understanding.
- The family’s requirement for physical amenities can be determined with the correct information. Our family can be prosperous if we accurately analyse our requirements and produce more than is necessary.
- Individuals and families benefit from right understanding, and understanding of human relationships leads to harmony and trust (fearlessness) in society. Fearlessness (mutual trust) in society will naturally follow when every individual is able to live harmoniously in relationship and the needs of all families are met.
- When humans with the right understanding interact with nature, it will be in accordance with coexistence and mutually enriching. We may also understand it in the following sequence:
- Right understanding
- Fearlessness (trust)
4. a. Elaborate the significance of education-sanskar for human being.
Ans. Sanskar refers to the moral and ethical mannerism that an individual learns in his or her early years of life. The significance of education-sanskar in human lives are follows:
- Correct Identification of our Aspirations: It allows us to correctly understand our needs and visualise our goals, as well as indicate the direction for their fulfilment. It also aids in the removal of our ambiguities and contradictions, bringing harmony on all levels.
- Understanding Universal Human Values to Fulfill our Aspirations in Continuity: Values serve as the foundation for all of our thoughts, behaviours, and actions. When we know what is important to us, we can use that knowledge to guide our actions.
- Complimentarity of Values and Skills: To achieve goals, both values and skills are required. When we set the right goals and take the right steps. This is referred to as the value domain, and when we learn and practice to achieve this goal, we develop the techniques to make it happen in real life. This is referred to domain of skills.
- Evaluation of our Beliefs: Each of us has certain beliefs that we base our values on, which may or may not be true in reality. It aids in the evaluation of our beliefs and assumed values.
- Technology and Human Values: The current educational system is largely skill-based. The primary focus is on science and technology. A critical component of the current educational system is value education. Because of this deficiency, most of our efforts may be counterproductive, and serious crises at the individual, societal, and environmental levels are manifesting.

Short Questions for Universal Human Values
a. Describe the two domains of education.
Ans. Two domains of education are:
1. Moral domain: It proposed that individuals acquire moral concepts about fairness, other welfare, and their own rights during childhood and adolescence.
2. Social domain: It proposed that individuals construct moral concepts from social interactions that promote welfare or justice.
b. How values and ethics are related?
Ans. Together, ethics and values lay the groundwork for long-term viability. Whereas ethics are the set of rules that govern a person’s behavior that is established by a group or culture, values are broad preferences regarding appropriate courses of action or outcomes.
c. What are the four levels of living?
Ans. The four levels of our living are:
- Living in myself.
- Living in the family.
- Living in society.
- Living in nature/existence.
d. How is the response of the body definite?
Ans. The body is a collection of “self-organized activities” that take place with self consent but without my active participation.These are functions like:
- Heart beat
- Blood flow
e. What are the different types of disrespect?
Ans. Respect means “right evaluation,” which means being evaluated as I am. Usually, however, we make mistakes in our evaluation in the following three ways:
- Over evaluation (abhi-mulyana)
- Under evaluation (ava-mulyana)
- Otherwise evaluation (a-mulyana)
f. What are the foundation value and complete value of the relationship?
Ans. 1. Foundation value: The foundation value in all relationships is trust. It is extremely important. Trust is built through our own actions, value systems, and responses.

- Plant/Bio order
- Animal order
- Human order
h. How processes in nature are cyclic?
Ans. In nature, we can see a number of cyclical processes. The cycle of water, for example, evaporating, condensing, and precipitating back to water produces weather phenomena. The cycle ensures that these materials are self-regulating on the planet.
i. List out five dimensions of the human order.
Ans. The five dimensions of human order are:
- Education: Right living (Siksha – Sanskar)
- Health: Self-regulation (Swasthya – Sanyam)

- Production: Work (Utpadan – Karya)
- Exchange: Storage (Vinimya – Kosh)
j. What is the outcome of harmony with the whole of nature/existence?
Ans. All issues are resolved by natural harmony with trees, including reduced wind speed, energy savings, companion planting, the creation of an eco-subsystem for creating a forest garden and decreased building heat.
Important Long Questions | Last year Long Question Universal Human Values
a. Describe the process of value education.
Ans. Process of Value Education:
- The process of value education must be one of self-exploration rather than preaching or telling dos and don’ts.
- Whatever is discovered as truth or reality may be stated as a proposal and must be independently verified.
- It is the process of dialogue between ‘What you are’ and ‘What you really want to be’.
- It is a process of becoming aware of oneself and, as a result, of one’s entire existence.
- It is the process of recognizing and fulfilling one’s relationship with every unit in existence.
- This process of self-exploration assists you in finding harmony within yourself and with everything around you.
b. Explain with examples the definite and indefinite response of the self.
Ans. 1. When it comes to self (‘I’), which is a conscious entity, there is also the activity of assuming and of knowing, in addition to ‘recognizing and fulfilling’.
2. In fact, recognizing and fulfilling in case of human beings will depend upon knowing and/or assuming.
- We make assumptions: We all make assumptions, and our responses (recognition and fulfillment) are based on those assumptions. For example, if I see a snake and mistake it for a rope, I will react differently than if I mistake it for a snake. This is referred to as assuming.
- We recognize: Today, we all recognize things, and we recognize a wide range of things. We recognize water, our parents, our friends, and so on. This is referred to as recognizing. The recognizing in ‘I’ is contingent on assuming.","What would happen to the concept of ""right living"" if the material order were to suddenly change its fundamental principles, leading to a drastic alteration of the environment in which humans live?","The concept of ""right living"" would likely undergo a significant transformation if the material order were to suddenly change its fundamental principles, leading to a drastic alteration of the environment in which humans live. The sudden change would likely disrupt the existing social, economic, and cultural structures, forcing humans to adapt to a new reality.

From a philosophical perspective, the concept of ""right living"" would need to be reevaluated in light of the new environmental conditions. This could involve redefining what it means to live a good life, taking into account the new challenges and opportunities presented by the changed environment.

For example, the concept of ""right living"" might shift from focusing on individual success and material wealth to prioritizing community resilience and sustainability. It could also involve reevaluating the relationship between humans and the natural world, recognizing the interconnectedness of all living beings and the need to live in harmony with the environment.

From a societal perspective, the sudden change would likely lead to a period of chaos and disruption, as humans struggle to adapt to the new reality. However, it could also present opportunities for innovation and growth, as humans develop new technologies and strategies to cope with the changed environment.

Ultimately, the concept of ""right living"" would need to be redefined in light of the new environmental conditions, taking into account the needs and values of individuals, communities, and the planet as a whole.","['https://www.noaa.gov/education/resource-collections/climate/climate-change-impacts', 'https://19january2017snapshot.epa.gov/climate-impacts/climate-impacts-ecosystems', 'https://www.upcolorado.com/excerpts/9781607321682.pdf', 'https://muse.jhu.edu/pub/173/oa_monograph/chapter/3773719', 'https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1wn0rbs', 'https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wcas/3/1/2011wcas1081_1.xml', 'https://climatechange.chicago.gov/climate-impacts/climate-impacts-human-health', 'https://climate.ec.europa.eu/climate-change/causes-climate-change_en', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9013542/', 'https://www.imperial.ac.uk/grantham/publications/climate-change-faqs/what-are-the-impacts-of-climate-change/', 'https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2019.0104', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4342958/', 'https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2018.0269', 'https://www.geosociety.org/gsatoday/archive/22/7/article/i1052-5173-22-7-60.htm', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4342965/', 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20977599/', 'https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-environmental/', 'https://issues.org/my-climate-change/', 'https://science.nasa.gov/climate-change/scientific-consensus/', 'https://www.migrationdataportal.org/sites/g/files/tmzbdl251/files/2023-06/Final5_2023%20Climate%20Change%20and%20Human%20Mobility.pdf']",education

Important Long Questions | Last year Long Question Universal Human Values
a. Describe the process of value education.
Ans. Process of Value Education:
- The process of value education must be one of self-exploration rather than preaching or telling dos and don’ts.
- Whatever is discovered as truth or reality may be stated as a proposal and must be independently verified.
- It is the process of dialogue between ‘What you are’ and ‘What you really want to be’.
- It is a process of becoming aware of oneself and, as a result, of one’s entire existence.
- It is the process of recognizing and fulfilling one’s relationship with every unit in existence.
- This process of self-exploration assists you in finding harmony within yourself and with everything around you.
b. Explain with examples the definite and indefinite response of the self.
Ans. 1. When it comes to self (‘I’), which is a conscious entity, there is also the activity of assuming and of knowing, in addition to ‘recognizing and fulfilling’.
2. In fact, recognizing and fulfilling in case of human beings will depend upon knowing and/or assuming.
- We make assumptions: We all make assumptions, and our responses (recognition and fulfillment) are based on those assumptions. For example, if I see a snake and mistake it for a rope, I will react differently than if I mistake it for a snake. This is referred to as assuming.
- We recognize: Today, we all recognize things, and we recognize a wide range of things. We recognize water, our parents, our friends, and so on. This is referred to as recognizing. The recognizing in ‘I’ is contingent on assuming.",How does the way we assume things about ourselves and others influence our ability to recognize and fulfill our true potential in relationships and personal growth?,"Our assumptions about ourselves and others can significantly impact our ability to recognize and fulfill our true potential in relationships and personal growth. These assumptions can shape our perceptions, behaviors, and interactions, influencing the dynamics of our relationships and our own personal development.

Assumptions can influence our relationships by creating unrealistic expectations, leading to misunderstandings and conflicts. For instance, assuming that someone is a certain way based on limited information can lead to miscommunication and hurt feelings. Similarly, assuming that we are not good enough or that others are not supportive can lead to feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem.

In personal growth, assumptions can hinder our progress by creating barriers to self-awareness and self-acceptance. For example, assuming that we are not capable of change or that we are stuck in a certain pattern can lead to stagnation and a lack of motivation. On the other hand, challenging our assumptions and being open to new experiences and perspectives can lead to personal growth and self-improvement.

To overcome the limitations of our assumptions, it is essential to develop self-awareness and critical thinking skills. This can be achieved by practicing mindfulness, seeking feedback from others, and engaging in self-reflection. By recognizing and challenging our assumptions, we can gain a deeper understanding of ourselves and others, leading to more authentic and fulfilling relationships and personal growth.

Multiple perspectives on this topic include:

* The importance of self-awareness in recognizing and challenging our assumptions (Johnson, 2022)
* The role of social relationships in shaping our assumptions and influencing our personal growth (Kuchenna, 2024)
* The impact of inaccurate assumptions on our relationships and personal growth (Quora, 2022)
* The need for discipline and self-regulation in personal growth (HBR, 2022)
* The importance of honest feedback and self-awareness in overcoming limitations (Counseling.org, 2022)

The recognizing in ‘I’ is contingent on assuming.","How does an individual's understanding of the concept of ""right evaluation"" impact their ability to build trust in relationships?","The concept of ""right evaluation"" plays a crucial role in building trust in relationships. It involves being able to assess situations objectively, make informed decisions, and communicate effectively. When an individual has a deep understanding of this concept, they are better equipped to evaluate situations accurately, make informed decisions, and communicate their thoughts and feelings effectively. This, in turn, helps to build trust with others, as they feel confident that their partner is making decisions based on a clear and objective evaluation of the situation.

From a psychological perspective, individuals who understand the concept of ""right evaluation"" are more likely to engage in empathetic and authentic communication, which is essential for building strong and trusting relationships. They are also more likely to be open to feedback and willing to adapt to changing circumstances, which helps to foster a sense of trust and cooperation.

In the context of romantic relationships, an individual's understanding of ""right evaluation"" can impact their ability to build trust in several ways. For example, they may be more likely to evaluate their partner's behavior objectively, rather than making assumptions or jumping to conclusions. This can help to prevent misunderstandings and conflicts, and create a more positive and trusting dynamic in the relationship.

In professional settings, an individual's understanding of ""right evaluation"" can also impact their ability to build trust with colleagues and clients. For example, they may be more likely to evaluate the effectiveness of a project or strategy objectively, rather than relying on personal biases or assumptions. This can help to build trust and credibility with others, and create a more productive and collaborative work environment.

Overall, an individual's understanding of the concept of ""right evaluation"" is essential for building trust in relationships. It involves being able to assess situations objectively, make informed decisions, and communicate effectively, which helps to create a sense of trust and cooperation with others.","['https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6996004/', 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10888691.2018.1537791', 'https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/school-discipline/guiding-principles.pdf', 'https://store.samhsa.gov/sites/default/files/pep22-06-01-005.pdf', 'https://extensionpublications.unl.edu/assets/html/g1375/build/g1375.htm', 'https://hbr.org/2023/02/what-is-psychological-safety', 'https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.1529-1006.2006.00030.x', 'https://www.yourthoughtpartner.com/blog/bid/59619/leaders-follow-these-6-steps-to-build-trust-with-employees-improve-how-you-re-perceived', 'https://ncsacw.acf.hhs.gov/userfiles/files/SAMHSA_Trauma.pdf', 'https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/19_0920_plcy_strategic-framework-countering-terrorism-targeted-violence.pdf', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6996004/', 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10888691.2018.1537791', 'https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/school-discipline/guiding-principles.pdf', 'https://store.samhsa.gov/sites/default/files/pep22-06-01-005.pdf', 'https://extensionpublications.unl.edu/assets/html/g1375/build/g1375.htm', 'https://hbr.org/2023/02/what-is-psychological-safety', 'https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.1529-1006.2006.00030.x', 'https://www.yourthoughtpartner.com/blog/bid/59619/leaders-follow-these-6-steps-to-build-trust-with-employees-improve-how-you-re-perceived', 'https://ncsacw.acf.hhs.gov/userfiles/files/SAMHSA_Trauma.pdf', 'https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/19_0920_plcy_strategic-framework-countering-terrorism-targeted-violence.pdf']",education

Here are some strategies that can be employed:

1. Prioritize tasks: Make a to-do list and prioritize tasks based on importance and deadlines. Focus on completing the most critical tasks first, and then move on to less pressing ones.
2. Set realistic goals: Set achievable goals for yourself, both academically and personally. Break down large tasks into smaller, manageable chunks, and celebrate your successes along the way.
3. Take breaks: Take regular breaks to rest and recharge. Go for a walk, do some stretching, or engage in a hobby to clear your mind and reduce stress.
4. Seek support: Reach out to friends, family, or a counselor for emotional support. Sharing your feelings and concerns with someone you trust can help you feel heard and understood.
5. Practice self-care: Engage in activities that bring you joy and relaxation, such as reading, listening to music, or taking a relaxing bath. Make time for self-care and prioritize your well-being.
6. Get enough sleep: Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep each night to help your body and mind recharge. Establish a consistent sleep schedule and create a bedtime routine to signal to your brain that it's time to sleep.
7. Stay organized: Use a planner, calendar, or app to stay organized and on track. Set reminders and notifications to help you stay on schedule and avoid last-minute cramming.
8. Seek help when needed: Don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it. Reach out to your professors, teaching assistants, or classmates for guidance or support.
9. Practice mindfulness: Practice mindfulness techniques, such as meditation or deep breathing, to help you stay present and focused. Mindfulness can help you manage stress and anxiety by reducing rumination and increasing self-awareness.
10. Take care of your physical health: Regular exercise, healthy eating, and staying hydrated can help improve your mood and reduce stress. Make time for physical activity and prioritize your physical health.

By incorporating these strategies into your daily routine, you can reduce your risk of burnout and maintain a healthy academic routine. Remember to prioritize your well-being and seek help when you need it.","['https://www.insidehighered.com/advice/2020/04/28/advice-faculty-help-them-avoid-burnout-during-pandemic-opinion', 'https://thespinoff.co.nz/society/13-02-2023/post-burnout-reflections-from-a-tired-secondary-teacher', 'https://www.insidehighered.com/advice/2017/01/13/learning-how-avoid-stress-department-chair-essay', 'https://loleen.substack.com/p/how-to-think-about-burnout-and-academia', 'https://www.pepperlandmarketing.com/blog/how-to-avoid-burnout-as-a-higher-education-social-media-manager', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/swl9xa/how_the_hell_do_you_push_through_a_burnoutfatigue/', 'https://www.nata.org/nata-now/articles/2016/04/burnout-athletes', 'https://pce.sandiego.edu/15-ways-to-prevent-teacher-burnout-faqs/', 'https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/things-schools-dont-teach-how-avoid-burnout-c%C3%A9sar-prieto-jim%C3%A9nez', 'https://regisdpt.org/2017/05/24/how-to-avoid-burnout-in-pt-school/', 'https://summer.harvard.edu/blog/managing-stress-in-high-school/', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8435111/', 'https://educationnorthwest.org/sites/default/files/resources/trauma-informed-practices-postsecondary-508.pdf', 'https://gsm.ucdavis.edu/blog/5-tips-grad-school-stress', 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02673843.2019.1596823', 'https://nchems.org/', 'https://abes.ca/blog/how-to-manage-stress-during-post-secondary-school-in-calgary/', 'https://good2talk.ca/resources/20-tips-from-post-secondary-students-for-managing-anxiety/', 'https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/education/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.660676/full', 'https://www.colorado.edu/center/teaching-learning/sites/default/files/attached-files/academics_strategies_for_coping_with_stress_and_emotions.pdf', 'https://educationnorthwest.org/sites/default/files/resources/trauma-informed-practices-postsecondary-508.pdf', 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02673843.2019.1596823', 'https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/stress-management-while-job-hunting-steve-martin', 'https://summer.harvard.edu/blog/managing-stress-in-high-school/', 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36096110/', 'https://www.acf.hhs.gov/trauma-toolkit/secondary-traumatic-stress', 'https://www.colorado.edu/center/teaching-learning/sites/default/files/attached-files/academics_strategies_for_coping_with_stress_and_emotions.pdf', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10076091/', 'https://www.thebossysauce.com/blog/certifications-from-major-universities-ivy-leagues-that-cost-less-than-ecornell-certifications-cornell-university', 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/nop2.982']",education

The next time you are teaching a lesson, count how many questions students are asked.
When students are herded and corralled into the narrow chute of standardized testing, they are so heavily indoctrinated with fear of failure that only a fool would dare venture off the beaten path. We are, after all, talking about young people, and can hardly expect them to rebel against it (considering this may make you rethink those students who actually do). The consequences of straying are so fierce: the promise of no job; the shame of failure; the ire of the school. It is no wonder then that students are afraid to take risks and think for themselves, and why inevitably so many unnecessary questions are asked.
To add insult to injury, when governments decide in their wisdom that the solution to ensuring progress in education is to standardize testing even more, they force schools to constrict curricula further. They reduce the opportunities to explore creativity in subjects. They trim a course down to its quantitative shell, and by doing so reduce a student’s opportunities to develop problem-solving strategies. Essentially, they force schools to produce hydroponic students.
Teaching Students In Authentic Contexts
Whilst using hydroponics to grow fruit and vegetables seems like the golden ticket to solving the world’s food problems, the method, while yielding ostensibly larger and faster produce, is significantly flawed in three ways: first, the final product lacks real nutrient and substance, and ultimately taste.
Secondly, the plant itself grows in a very unnatural and toxic state, absorbing inordinate quantities of chemicals and pesticides to control it at every turn, which must affect its overall enjoyment in growing, and thirdly, once the plant is gone and the process is over, it leaves no positive legacy – in fact, it depletes the ground around it. When students are taught in unnatural conditions, with the sole purpose of producing quantifiable results, they too suffer in three similar ways:
First, when they finish their education with a whole lot of credentials, (if they have managed to get through the system), they may lack any real depth of knowledge and any ability to problem solve. This is because the learning has been too shallow, only concentrating on aspects of a course that need to be learned for standardized testing. Like the roots of the hydroponic plant, the brain’s synapses aren’t encouraged to expand and strengthen because there isn’t any opportunity or need to do so. The more prescriptive the learning, the less chance the student has to wander off the path, and get dirty, and find solutions to get out of the mud. Necessity is the mother of invention, but when students aren’t ever given such chances, they lose the capacity to think on their feet, and eventually, to think for themselves in most situations.
Secondly, if students are encased day after day in the confines of the school building, seated for extraordinary long periods of time in rows of desks, and ushered from class to lunch to class under the strict timings of bells, the process of distancing the young from their natural condition is well underway. If students are doused with pointless and irrelevant information disguised as learning, it is obvious that they won’t enjoy school.
Even well-meaning teachers can fall foul to the system, themselves operating in fear of not covering the required territory. In fact, it’s an impossible feat to teach the amount of stipulated material of most subjects to any level of depth to the average class. To curb the natural inclination of students to disengage in such a learning context, schools superficially inoculate their students with countless tirades, warning against disengagement and punishing culprits in attempts to quell it. It is no wonder that students can feel that their paths in learning and growth have become stifled and one-directional and oppressed. It is no wonder they rarely if ever connect learning with happiness.

The next time you are teaching a lesson, count how many questions students are asked.
When students are herded and corralled into the narrow chute of standardized testing, they are so heavily indoctrinated with fear of failure that only a fool would dare venture off the beaten path. We are, after all, talking about young people, and can hardly expect them to rebel against it (considering this may make you rethink those students who actually do). The consequences of straying are so fierce: the promise of no job; the shame of failure; the ire of the school. It is no wonder then that students are afraid to take risks and think for themselves, and why inevitably so many unnecessary questions are asked.
To add insult to injury, when governments decide in their wisdom that the solution to ensuring progress in education is to standardize testing even more, they force schools to constrict curricula further. They reduce the opportunities to explore creativity in subjects. They trim a course down to its quantitative shell, and by doing so reduce a student’s opportunities to develop problem-solving strategies. Essentially, they force schools to produce hydroponic students.
Teaching Students In Authentic Contexts
Whilst using hydroponics to grow fruit and vegetables seems like the golden ticket to solving the world’s food problems, the method, while yielding ostensibly larger and faster produce, is significantly flawed in three ways: first, the final product lacks real nutrient and substance, and ultimately taste.
Secondly, the plant itself grows in a very unnatural and toxic state, absorbing inordinate quantities of chemicals and pesticides to control it at every turn, which must affect its overall enjoyment in growing, and thirdly, once the plant is gone and the process is over, it leaves no positive legacy – in fact, it depletes the ground around it. When students are taught in unnatural conditions, with the sole purpose of producing quantifiable results, they too suffer in three similar ways:
First, when they finish their education with a whole lot of credentials, (if they have managed to get through the system), they may lack any real depth of knowledge and any ability to problem solve. This is because the learning has been too shallow, only concentrating on aspects of a course that need to be learned for standardized testing. Like the roots of the hydroponic plant, the brain’s synapses aren’t encouraged to expand and strengthen because there isn’t any opportunity or need to do so. The more prescriptive the learning, the less chance the student has to wander off the path, and get dirty, and find solutions to get out of the mud. Necessity is the mother of invention, but when students aren’t ever given such chances, they lose the capacity to think on their feet, and eventually, to think for themselves in most situations.
Secondly, if students are encased day after day in the confines of the school building, seated for extraordinary long periods of time in rows of desks, and ushered from class to lunch to class under the strict timings of bells, the process of distancing the young from their natural condition is well underway. If students are doused with pointless and irrelevant information disguised as learning, it is obvious that they won’t enjoy school.
Even well-meaning teachers can fall foul to the system, themselves operating in fear of not covering the required territory. In fact, it’s an impossible feat to teach the amount of stipulated material of most subjects to any level of depth to the average class. To curb the natural inclination of students to disengage in such a learning context, schools superficially inoculate their students with countless tirades, warning against disengagement and punishing culprits in attempts to quell it. It is no wonder that students can feel that their paths in learning and growth have become stifled and one-directional and oppressed. It is no wonder they rarely if ever connect learning with happiness.
Thirdly, because of the shallowness of the learning required for standardized tests, and the lack of base in the knowledge creation, the transference of the learning into new contexts is limited. The process yields little reward after the examination period, and does little to sustain the learner, or indeed the community around him or her.

So just picking up on what Nancy said we have been actually used virtual reality perhaps people pick up on like it's a new thing. But I've been working in virtual reality for over 20 years and special schools, which students with autism, there's a really strong evidence base, but Nancy might be right that's in the academic community. So we know that virtual environments have been used to teach independent living skills to students with learning disabilities, employment skills, but it can also augment cognitive skills, such as working memory, choice, reaction time, independent decision making. That's all in the academic literature. So now that we have the second, it's actually the third or fourth wave of virtual reality. So we have headsets like the Oculus quest, for 400 pounds wireless, you can have incredible virtual experiences. But there's also the evidence base of perhaps our challenge in academia, is join with government organisations and join with Nesta as well to actually get that information that evidence base as teachers in terms of what works in terms of game making virtual environments. And in terms of robotics as well, where we've all had positive European projects, which show those technologies can teach skills, but they can also engaging people and encourage collaboration and better behavior. So I think perhaps the challenge is universities to work with government and non government organisations now to get that information to teachers, because there's a lot of evidence already existing about what works and what doesn't work. So we need to augment the evidence base and build it as well.
And to go to James's question, and this just pops up I have a I could associate it with quite a lot I'm of the generation and where the interactive whiteboard was rolled out in every classroom across the country, before very swiftly Blackboard in front of it, because the teacher had no idea how to use it. And if they did, add very little value to the classroom anyway, at least that was my, my experience. So I would I would I would repeat everything that's been said about the need, actually for schools and colleges universities to be supported. I would I would pose the question of who is curating the knowledge, who is curating the pedagogy and all the different things that are going on in the system. You know, you look at other professions, like, you know, in medicine, you have the BMA, they'll curate that. So I think there is a role here for the College of teaching, to actually step up and start playing that role and curating the knowledge crazy understanding. And I would point to one of the most fascinating examples of this in Japan, but their entire co equivalent of Ofsted and their framework actually has it built into it collaboration to teachers and schools are actually rewarded for sharing lesson plans for sharing what works and things like that. So I would pose the question of, you know, why do we have a body this kind of purpose is to curate, the knowledge and the system and to sort of spread breath practice. Why don't we have like the rest of the economy out of the country, we have a 2.4% R&D investment target as a country? Why do we not have a 2.4% equivalent target actually in pedagogy in education, where we are investing in research as a country, about these new methods.
That's a fantastic note on which to end this panel. And I genuinely think that maybe the education endowment foundation might be the organisation that could pick that up and curate that. And the beauty of this event is that the ideas that are generated here will be taken forward. So you heard it here first, a teaching toolkit from the education endowment foundation. I'm signing them up to it now about effective use of technology. Can I thank you for your involvement. And also add my thanks to yours for the panel.

1. Immersive learning experiences: Virtual reality can provide students with immersive and interactive learning experiences that can engage and motivate them. This can be particularly beneficial for students with learning disabilities who may struggle with traditional teaching methods.

2. Personalized learning: Virtual reality can be used to create personalized learning experiences that cater to individual students' needs and abilities. This can help students with learning disabilities to better understand and retain complex information.

3. Accessibility: Virtual reality can provide students with learning disabilities with greater accessibility to educational resources and experiences. For example, virtual reality can allow students with physical disabilities to participate in simulations and activities that may be difficult or impossible for them to participate in physically.

4. Social skills development: Virtual reality can be used to help students with learning disabilities develop social skills, such as communication and collaboration. This can be particularly beneficial for students who may struggle with social interactions due to their disability.

5. Data analysis: Virtual reality can provide educators with valuable data on how students interact with educational resources and experiences. This data can be used to optimize educational resources and improve student outcomes.

6. Teacher training: Virtual reality can be used to provide teachers with training and professional development opportunities. This can help teachers to better understand how to use virtual reality to support students with learning disabilities and to develop their own skills and confidence in using virtual reality.

7. Collaboration: Virtual reality can be used to facilitate collaboration and communication between students, teachers, and other stakeholders. This can help to create a more inclusive and supportive learning environment for students with learning disabilities.

8. Accessibility of virtual reality: Virtual reality can be made accessible to students with learning disabilities by providing assistive technologies, such as text-to-speech software, speech-to-text software, and other accommodations.

9. Virtual reality in the classroom: Virtual reality can be used in the classroom to provide students with interactive and engaging learning experiences. This can help to increase student motivation and engagement, and to improve student outcomes.

10. Virtual reality in special education: Virtual reality can be used in special education to provide students with learning disabilities with personalized and tailored learning experiences. This can help to improve student outcomes and to increase student engagement and motivation.

By considering these perspectives and strategies, higher education institutions can leverage virtual reality to enhance the student experience and increase student retention rates, particularly for students with learning disabilities.","['https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8281102/', 'https://edtechmagazine.com/higher/article/2016/11/how-virtual-reality-could-change-way-students-experience-education', 'https://elearningindustry.com/ways-to-enhance-the-student-learning-experience-with-technology', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0097849324000797', 'https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2018/10/virtual-reality-can-help-make-people-empathetic', 'https://www.talespin.com/reading/enhancing-learning-experiences-with-virtual-reality', 'https://www.emorybusiness.com/2021/04/28/the-future-is-now-goizuetas-digital-learning-innovations-to-enhance-student-experience-strengthen-global-reach/', 'https://online.lsu.edu/newsroom/articles/how-virtual-reality-changing-education/', 'https://www.timeshighereducation.com/campus/how-apply-virtual-reality-enhance-learning-experiences', 'https://madisoncollege.edu/about/news/leading-way-virtual-reality', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8281102/', 'https://itif.org/publications/2021/08/30/promise-immersive-learning-augmented-and-virtual-reality-potential/', 'https://soeonline.american.edu/blog/benefits-of-virtual-reality-in-education/', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10047908/', 'https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2023/04/technology-might-be-making-education-worse', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1096751621000130', 'https://www.classvr.com/benefits-of-virtual-reality-in-education/', 'https://virtualspeech.com/blog/augmented-virtual-reality-future-of-learning-experience', 'https://elearningindustry.com/ways-to-enhance-the-student-learning-experience-with-technology', 'https://www.i3-technologies.com/en/blog/stories/education/vr-in-the-classroom-benefits-and-drawbacks/', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8281102/', 'https://itif.org/publications/2021/08/30/promise-immersive-learning-augmented-and-virtual-reality-potential/', 'https://soeonline.american.edu/blog/benefits-of-virtual-reality-in-education/', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10047908/', 'https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2023/04/technology-might-be-making-education-worse', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1096751621000130', 'https://www.classvr.com/benefits-of-virtual-reality-in-education/', 'https://virtualspeech.com/blog/augmented-virtual-reality-future-of-learning-experience', 'https://elearningindustry.com/ways-to-enhance-the-student-learning-experience-with-technology', 'https://www.i3-technologies.com/en/blog/stories/education/vr-in-the-classroom-benefits-and-drawbacks/']",education

But there's also the evidence base of perhaps our challenge in academia, is join with government organisations and join with Nesta as well to actually get that information that evidence base as teachers in terms of what works in terms of game making virtual environments. And in terms of robotics as well, where we've all had positive European projects, which show those technologies can teach skills, but they can also engaging people and encourage collaboration and better behavior. So I think perhaps the challenge is universities to work with government and non government organisations now to get that information to teachers, because there's a lot of evidence already existing about what works and what doesn't work. So we need to augment the evidence base and build it as well.
And to go to James's question, and this just pops up I have a I could associate it with quite a lot I'm of the generation and where the interactive whiteboard was rolled out in every classroom across the country, before very swiftly Blackboard in front of it, because the teacher had no idea how to use it. And if they did, add very little value to the classroom anyway, at least that was my, my experience. So I would I would I would repeat everything that's been said about the need, actually for schools and colleges universities to be supported. I would I would pose the question of who is curating the knowledge, who is curating the pedagogy and all the different things that are going on in the system. You know, you look at other professions, like, you know, in medicine, you have the BMA, they'll curate that. So I think there is a role here for the College of teaching, to actually step up and start playing that role and curating the knowledge crazy understanding. And I would point to one of the most fascinating examples of this in Japan, but their entire co equivalent of Ofsted and their framework actually has it built into it collaboration to teachers and schools are actually rewarded for sharing lesson plans for sharing what works and things like that. So I would pose the question of, you know, why do we have a body this kind of purpose is to curate, the knowledge and the system and to sort of spread breath practice. Why don't we have like the rest of the economy out of the country, we have a 2.4% R&D investment target as a country? Why do we not have a 2.4% equivalent target actually in pedagogy in education, where we are investing in research as a country, about these new methods.
That's a fantastic note on which to end this panel. And I genuinely think that maybe the education endowment foundation might be the organisation that could pick that up and curate that. And the beauty of this event is that the ideas that are generated here will be taken forward. So you heard it here first, a teaching toolkit from the education endowment foundation.

1. **User-centered design**: Involve students with disabilities in the design process to ensure that VR experiences are tailored to their needs and abilities.
2. **Accessibility features**: Incorporate accessibility features such as text-to-speech, audio descriptions, and closed captions to make VR experiences more accessible.
3. **Multi-sensory experiences**: Incorporate multiple senses, such as sight, sound, and touch, to provide a more immersive and engaging experience for students with disabilities.
4. **Customizable interfaces**: Allow students to customize the VR interface to suit their individual needs, such as adjusting font sizes or colors.
5. **Training and support**: Provide training and support for educators and students on how to use VR technology and troubleshoot any accessibility issues that may arise.
6. **Inclusive content**: Ensure that VR content is inclusive and representative of diverse cultures, abilities, and experiences.
7. **Feedback mechanisms**: Establish feedback mechanisms to gather input from students with disabilities on their VR experiences and make necessary adjustments.
8. **Collaboration with disability organizations**: Collaborate with disability organizations and advocacy groups to ensure that VR experiences are designed with the needs of students with disabilities in mind.
9. **Research and evaluation**: Conduct research and evaluation to assess the effectiveness of VR experiences in promoting inclusive learning and to identify areas for improvement.
10. **Continuous improvement**: Continuously improve and update VR experiences to ensure that they remain accessible and inclusive for students with diverse abilities.

What impact does EdTech have on social mobility? How can we best prepare young people for future opportunities and ensure lifelong learning? What impact does the Government’s National Retraining Scheme have on teaching and learning? This conversation is chaired by Andy Mellor (National Immediate Past President, NAHT), with panellists Nancy Wilkinson (Senior Programme Manager, Nesta), Professor David Brown (Professor of Interactive Systems for Social Inclusion, Nottingham Trent University) and John Cope (Head of Education & Skills Policy, Confederation of British Industry). This panel discussion was recorded live on 14th November 2019, in the Main Stage of the Schools & Academies Show at the NEC in Birmingham.
Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome to our next session, our panel session on technology and the role of technology in improving social mobility. So we've had to just begin by asking everybody to introduce themselves and just say a little bit about who they are, where they're from.
So I'm Nancy Wilkinson, and I work at an organisation called Nesta. So Nesta is an innovation foundation, which basically means we try and work on different problems particularly to do with social good and we find new ways of doing tackling those. And education is a real focus for us in our organisation. And I'll tell you in a second, a little bit about some of our work that we're doing on edtech. But a bit about my background. So I have worked in education policy for the last eight years, and I'm now leading our work at Nesta on education technology. I'm also a school governor in a small Primary School in Tower Hamlets in London. So I see as well as some of the day to day challenges of working with schools, particularly from disadvantaged communities. So just very briefly on Nesta's work in edtech. So we working in partnership with the Department for Education, to help schools and colleges make more effective use of technology. We think it has some real potential to do some great things in our education sector, but it often doesn't live up to expectations, it can often be difficult to use. It's difficult for schools to know what to choose that's right for them. So we have two programs that we're working on. One is a grant funding program, which we announced yesterday, some of the winners of that grant funding, which are all digital tools that we think can be really helpful for schools and teachers, particularly in tackling teacher workload. And the second half of our program is our edtech innovation testbed. So that's an opportunity for schools and colleges to take part in trying out technology for free with working with an external evaluator to really get to grips on what's working so we can get some better evidence for what's out there. So this is my tiny plug. Applications for schools and colleges are open now. So if anyone has any questions about that specifically, you can find me afterwards but yeah, really excited for the discussion. Thank you.
Professor David Brown
So good afternoon. My name is David Brown. I'm Professor of interactive systems for social inclusion at Nottingham Trent University. I'm principal investigator for three European and I said European grants. One is to use machine learning and artificial intelligence to create personalised learning systems for students with autism and learning disabilities. But also for students in higher education, you might be surprised to find that students in higher education aren't always engaged in the learning process. So I've developed projects on educational robotics on serious games, and more recently on digital game based making as well, not just using games, but making games as well. More recently, we have another ESRC funded project. And I'm looking at the well being of young students in education. So again, we use sensor data that might be we're co creating objects, which are networked that children use in schools and the sensor data that can interpret their level of anxiety and we can then introduce non medicalised approaches to intervene. So we're looking at personalised learning systems, virtual reality, augmented reality, robotics, game making, and well being.","How might the use of educational games in a multicultural classroom setting influence the development of critical thinking skills in students, and what factors should be considered when designing such games to ensure cultural sensitivity?","The use of educational games in a multicultural classroom setting can be a powerful tool for developing critical thinking skills in students, but it's essential to consider the cultural sensitivity of the games to ensure they are effective and inclusive.","['https://eudl.eu/pdf/10.4108/eai.20-8-2019.2288079', 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jcal.12487', 'https://soeonline.american.edu/blog/benefits-of-inclusion-and-diversity-in-the-classroom/', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871187122001134', 'https://www.naeyc.org/resources/pubs/yc/nov2019/understanding-anti-bias', 'https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/1521/4/042125/pdf', 'https://typeset.io/questions/how-do-street-games-tradional-games-foster-critical-thinking-4t22ep9fys', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10054602/', 'https://educationnorthwest.org/sites/default/files/resources/culturally-responsive-teaching.pdf', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/19/magazine/19video-t.html', 'https://drexel.edu/soe/resources/student-teaching/advice/importance-of-cultural-diversity-in-classroom/', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7496989/', 'https://www.pearson.com/languages/en-us/community/blogs/cultural-sensitivity-in-language-teaching-2-24.html', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8514292/', 'https://www.edutopia.org/blog/preparing-cultural-diversity-resources-teachers', 'https://educationnorthwest.org/sites/default/files/resources/culturally-responsive-teaching.pdf', 'https://www.continentalpress.com/blog/cultural-diversity-in-the-classroom/', 'https://theartofeducation.edu/2016/11/5-ways-help-create-culturally-sensitive-classroom/', 'https://migrant-integration.ec.europa.eu/library-document/interaction-multicultural-classroom-towards-culturally-sensitive-home-economics_en', 'https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/culturally-responsive-teaching-culturally-responsive-pedagogy/2022/04']",education

On one hand, decentralization may allow for more autonomy and flexibility in the implementation of EdTech initiatives, potentially leading to more effective and targeted interventions that address the specific needs of different student populations. This could be particularly beneficial for students from disadvantaged backgrounds, who may benefit from more personalized and tailored support.

On the other hand, decentralization may also lead to a lack of coordination and consistency across different schools and regions, potentially resulting in a fragmented and inefficient use of EdTech resources. Additionally, the shift towards decentralization may also lead to a greater reliance on private providers and philanthropic organizations, which could exacerbate existing social and economic inequalities.

Furthermore, the search results suggest that the use of digital technology has the potential to transform education and promote social mobility, but it is also important to consider the potential risks and challenges associated with its implementation. For example, the availability of funding and resources may be unevenly distributed, and the use of digital technology may also perpetuate existing social and economic inequalities.

In conclusion, the implications of a shift towards a more decentralized education system in the UK on the ability of schools to effectively implement EdTech initiatives that promote social mobility are complex and context-dependent. While decentralization may offer opportunities for greater autonomy and flexibility, it is also important to consider the potential risks and challenges associated with its implementation, and to ensure that EdTech initiatives are designed and implemented in a way that promotes equity and social mobility.","['https://gem-report-2023.unesco.org/technology-in-education/', 'https://www.oecd.org/en/about/projects/education-policy-outlook.html', 'https://www.imaginablefutures.com/documents/20/Scaling_Access_and_Impact_Indonesia_Report_vFinal_r.pdf', 'https://chanzuckerberg.com/education/impact/', 'https://www2.ed.gov/documents/ai-report/ai-report.pdf', 'https://www.hks.harvard.edu/centers/cid', 'https://www.holoniq.com/2030', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9008096/', 'https://appinventiv.com/blog/artificial-intelligence-in-education/', 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01587919.2023.2267475', 'https://www.oecd.org/en/about/projects/education-policy-outlook.html', 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01587919.2023.2267475', 'https://gem-report-2023.unesco.org/technology-in-education/', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9008096/', 'https://www.imaginablefutures.com/documents/20/Scaling_Access_and_Impact_Indonesia_Report_vFinal_r.pdf', 'https://www.hks.harvard.edu/centers/cid', 'https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/learningrfi_submissions2014.pdf', 'https://chanzuckerberg.com/education/impact/', 'https://www2.ed.gov/documents/ai-report/ai-report.pdf', 'https://appinventiv.com/blog/artificial-intelligence-in-education/', 'https://www.oecd.org/en/about/projects/education-policy-outlook.html', 'https://www.imaginablefutures.com/documents/20/Scaling_Access_and_Impact_Indonesia_Report_vFinal_r.pdf', 'https://appinventiv.com/blog/artificial-intelligence-in-education/', 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01587919.2023.2267475', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9008096/', 'https://www.hks.harvard.edu/centers/cid', 'https://gem-report-2023.unesco.org/technology-in-education/', 'https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_New_Vision_for_Education.pdf', 'https://one.oecd.org/document/EDU/WKP(2020)27/En/pdf', 'https://iated.org/talks/']",education

So we're looking at personalised learning systems, virtual reality, augmented reality, robotics, game making, and well being.","How do you think the EdTech innovation testbed could be adapted to support the development of critical thinking skills in students, and what potential challenges or limitations might arise from such an approach?","To adapt the EdTech innovation testbed to support the development of critical thinking skills in students, we can consider integrating critical thinking exercises and assessments into the platform.

1. Reading challenges: Encourage students to read a certain number of books or explore different genres within a specified time frame. This can help them develop a sense of accomplishment and motivation to continue reading.
2. Balanced reading diets: Expose students to a variety of genres, including fiction, non-fiction, poetry, and more. This can help them develop a broad range of reading skills and interests.
3. Reading conferences: Use reading conferences to refer to the reading wheel and encourage students to read from different genres that appear to be neglected in their wheel.
4. Setting reading goals: Encourage students to set personal reading goals, such as reading a certain number of books or exploring different genres.
5. Teaching reading strategies: Teach children various reading strategies, such as summarizing, questioning, and visualizing, to help them engage with books and develop a lifelong love for reading.
6. Exploring different genres: Encourage children to explore different genres, including mystery, science-fiction, comic books, historical fiction, cook-books, biographies, non-fiction, and more.
7. Reading aloud: Read aloud to children regularly, and encourage them to read aloud to you. This can help them develop their reading skills and a love for reading.
8. Creating a reading-friendly environment: Create a reading-friendly environment in the classroom or at home by providing a comfortable and inviting space for reading.
9. Modeling good reading habits: Model good reading habits yourself, such as reading regularly and discussing books with others. This can help children develop a love for reading and see the value in reading.
10. Providing access to books: Provide children with access to a wide range of books, including books that reflect their interests and backgrounds. This can help them develop a love for reading and see themselves reflected in the books they read.

By considering these strategies and providing a supportive and engaging reading environment, you can help children develop a lifelong love of reading and a sense of community and social responsibility.","['http://www.thinkgrowgiggle.com/2021/08/must-try-tip-to-encourage-students-to.html', 'https://www.classroomnook.com/blog/reading-genres', 'https://blog.education.nationalgeographic.org/2020/09/24/how-to-use-mirror-and-window-books-to-encourage-global-citizenship/', 'https://pickatale.com/blog/reading-across-genres-broadening-horizons-and-expanding-tastes', 'https://www.beanstack.com/blog/20-ways-to-encourage-high-school-students-to-read-more', 'https://intl.renaissance.com/how-to-enhance-reading-comprehension-for-your-students/', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7036210/', 'https://www.readingrockets.org/topics/classroom-management/articles/literacy-rich-environments', 'https://fpblog.fountasandpinnell.com/exploring-the-essential-types-of-texts-every-young-learner-should-read', 'https://maed.co/tips-to-encourage-your-child-to-read/', 'https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/benefits-reading-pleasure-kelli-richards', 'https://www.drlaurencook.com/blog/nurturing-a-lifelong-love-for-reading-a-guide-for-parents', 'https://www.beanstack.com/blog/20-ways-to-encourage-high-school-students-to-read-more', 'https://www.internationalschoolparent.com/articles/light-the-spark-igniting-a-lifelong-love-of-reading-in-our-children/', 'https://nantucketlighthouseschool.org/finding-joy-in-reading/', 'https://zenhabits.net/how-to-instill-the-love-of-reading-in-your-child-or-yourself/', 'https://unitedthroughreading.org/seven-ways-to-model-good-reading-habits-for-children/', 'https://www.shcsc.k12.in.us/article/1645890', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7036210/', 'https://doctorteachermommy.com/my-baby-can-read-how-reading-to-infants-develops-a-lifelong-love-of-reading/', 'https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/benefits-reading-pleasure-kelli-richards', 'https://www.drlaurencook.com/blog/nurturing-a-lifelong-love-for-reading-a-guide-for-parents', 'https://www.beanstack.com/blog/20-ways-to-encourage-high-school-students-to-read-more', 'https://www.internationalschoolparent.com/articles/light-the-spark-igniting-a-lifelong-love-of-reading-in-our-children/', 'https://nantucketlighthouseschool.org/finding-joy-in-reading/', 'https://zenhabits.net/how-to-instill-the-love-of-reading-in-your-child-or-yourself/', 'https://unitedthroughreading.org/seven-ways-to-model-good-reading-habits-for-children/', 'https://www.shcsc.k12.in.us/article/1645890', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7036210/', 'https://doctorteachermommy.com/my-baby-can-read-how-reading-to-infants-develops-a-lifelong-love-of-reading/']",education

Here are some strategies that schools can use:

1. Foster a sense of community: Schools can create a sense of community by hosting events and activities that bring parents and children together. This can help parents feel more connected to the school and more likely to engage in discussions with their children about current events.

2. Provide resources and support: Schools can provide resources and support to help parents engage in discussions with their children about current events. This can include providing information about current events, offering guidance on how to discuss current events with children, and providing opportunities for parents to practice discussing current events with their children.

3. Encourage parental involvement: Schools can encourage parental involvement by providing opportunities for parents to participate in school activities and events. This can help parents feel more connected to the school and more likely to engage in discussions with their children about current events.

4. Use technology: Schools can use technology to facilitate discussions about current events between parents and children. This can include using social media platforms, online discussion forums, and other digital tools to facilitate discussions.

5. Provide opportunities for children to share their thoughts and opinions: Schools can provide opportunities for children to share their thoughts and opinions about current events. This can help children feel more engaged and invested in the discussion, and can also help parents understand their children's perspectives on current events.

6. Encourage empathy and understanding: Schools can encourage empathy and understanding by providing opportunities for children to discuss current events in a safe and supportive environment. This can help children develop a deeper understanding of current events and can also help them develop empathy and compassion for others.

7. Provide opportunities for parents to learn about current events: Schools can provide opportunities for parents to learn about current events by offering workshops, seminars, and other educational programs. This can help parents feel more informed and more confident in their ability to discuss current events with their children.

8. Encourage parents to ask questions: Schools can encourage parents to ask questions by providing opportunities for parents to ask questions and seek clarification about current events. This can help parents feel more engaged and more confident in their ability to discuss current events with their children.

9. Provide opportunities for children to engage in service projects: Schools can provide opportunities for children to engage in service projects related to current events. This can help children develop a deeper understanding of current events and can also help them develop empathy and compassion for others.

10. Encourage parents to share their own experiences: Schools can encourage parents to share their own experiences and perspectives on current events. This can help children feel more connected to their parents and more likely to engage in discussions about current events.

By using these strategies, schools can encourage parents to engage in discussions with their children about current events, while also promoting critical thinking and respect for others.","['https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2782391/', 'https://www.aecf.org/blog/parental-involvement-is-key-to-student-success-research-shows', 'https://www.edweek.org/leadership/does-parent-involvement-really-help-students-heres-what-the-research-says/2023/07', 'https://www.learningforjustice.org/discussing-war-and-conflict-resources-for-educators-parents-and-caregivers', 'https://nij.ojp.gov/topics/articles/hidden-consequences-impact-incarceration-dependent-children', 'https://www.adl.org/education/resources/tools-and-strategies/table-talk', 'https://parentandteen.com/school-involvement/', 'https://www.gottman.com/blog/want-to-improve-your-relationship-start-paying-more-attention-to-bids/', 'https://mybrightwheel.com/blog/boost-family-participation-at-your-childcare-center-or-preschool', 'https://www.childrensmercy.org/parent-ish/2021/09/diversity/', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2782391/', 'https://www.aecf.org/blog/parental-involvement-is-key-to-student-success-research-shows', 'https://www.edweek.org/leadership/does-parent-involvement-really-help-students-heres-what-the-research-says/2023/07', 'https://www.learningforjustice.org/discussing-war-and-conflict-resources-for-educators-parents-and-caregivers', 'https://nij.ojp.gov/topics/articles/hidden-consequences-impact-incarceration-dependent-children', 'https://www.adl.org/education/resources/tools-and-strategies/table-talk', 'https://parentandteen.com/school-involvement/', 'https://www.gottman.com/blog/want-to-improve-your-relationship-start-paying-more-attention-to-bids/', 'https://mybrightwheel.com/blog/boost-family-participation-at-your-childcare-center-or-preschool', 'https://www.childrensmercy.org/parent-ish/2021/09/diversity/', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2782391/', 'https://www.aecf.org/blog/parental-involvement-is-key-to-student-success-research-shows', 'https://www.edweek.org/leadership/does-parent-involvement-really-help-students-heres-what-the-research-says/2023/07', 'https://www.learningforjustice.org/discussing-war-and-conflict-resources-for-educators-parents-and-caregivers', 'https://nij.ojp.gov/topics/articles/hidden-consequences-impact-incarceration-dependent-children', 'https://www.adl.org/education/resources/tools-and-strategies/table-talk', 'https://parentandteen.com/school-involvement/', 'https://www.gottman.com/blog/want-to-improve-your-relationship-start-paying-more-attention-to-bids/', 'https://mybrightwheel.com/blog/boost-family-participation-at-your-childcare-center-or-preschool', 'https://www.childrensmercy.org/parent-ish/2021/09/diversity/']",education

THE MEANS USED
In order to achieve these objectives and to succeed in the mission of giving your child a complete education in accordance with our values, we have set up a pedagogical organisation to respond to the diversity of the students.
Within each class, the teacher in charge proposes :
We are aware that it is important for you, as parents, to have a clear and regular overview of the progress of your children’s work. To this end, we have set up a personalised follow-up during the school year. This is structured as follows:
IN cycle 1
We start in the kindergarten section, where a personal follow-up is set up for your child.
Your child receives an evaluation booklet at the end of the year which shows what he/she has learned and what he/she still needs to learn or is learning.
IN cycles 2 et 3
The graded assessment is implemented, which allows your children to be assessed according to the objective of the common base of knowledge.
These graded assessments are included in the report cards which will be given to you every six weeks and before each school holiday.
The need for an alternative approach to measuring your child’s personal development is appreciated and assessed in the skills booklet given to families.
Our experience has shown us that if a child’s success is visible through his good grades and his motivation to go to school, it can only really be measured at the end of his physical, intellectual and spiritual development. Their capacity for adaptability and openness to the world will enable them to become the citizens of tomorrow with confidence.
In educating the young people entrusted to us in the Truth, Beauty, Goodness and Justice, it is the light of Jesus Christ that illuminates the character of our school.

"The philosophy and spirit of Notre-Dame Saint-Roch School is oriented towards a global education that includes knowledge and values. To achieve this, we want to offer a school that educates as well as teaches.
As parents, you are the first educators of your children: the responsibility for educational training lies partly with the school, but it can only complement what each child receives at home. Your active participation is essential to create a real harmony between family education and school education. Naturally, this creates a relationship of trust and dialogue between the educational team and you as parents.

Learn which might be the right fit for your child's education.",How might a philosophical framework that emphasizes the importance of human flourishing influence the design of educational software meant to support student well-being and mental health?,"The philosophical framework that emphasizes human flourishing can influence the design of educational software by prioritizing student well-being and mental health through a holistic approach. This can be achieved by incorporating features that promote student engagement, social-emotional learning, and emotional intelligence. The software can also provide resources and support for students to manage stress, anxiety, and other mental health concerns. Additionally, the software can be designed to promote a sense of community and connection among students, teachers, and parents, which can help to foster a positive and supportive learning environment.

Here are some multiple perspectives and a detailed breakdown:

1. Aristotle's concept of eudaimonia, or human flourishing, can be applied to the design of educational software by prioritizing student well-being and mental health. This can be achieved by incorporating features that promote student engagement, social-emotional learning, and emotional intelligence.

2. The concept of ""flow"" by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi can be applied to the design of educational software by creating an environment that is challenging yet rewarding, and that allows students to fully engage and focus on their learning.

3. The concept of ""self-determination theory"" by Edward Deci and Richard Ryan can be applied to the design of educational software by providing students with autonomy, competence, and relatedness, which can help to promote intrinsic motivation and engagement.

4. The concept of ""positive psychology"" by Martin Seligman can be applied to the design of educational software by incorporating features that promote positive emotions, strengths, and well-being.

5. The concept of ""mindfulness"" by Jon Kabat-Zinn can be applied to the design of educational software by providing students with mindfulness exercises and techniques that can help to reduce stress and anxiety.

6. The concept of ""emotional intelligence"" by Daniel Goleman can be applied to the design of educational software by providing students with emotional intelligence training and exercises that can help to improve their emotional awareness and regulation.

7. The concept of ""social-emotional learning"" by Daniel Siegel and Tina Payne Bryson can be applied to the design of educational software by incorporating features that promote social-emotional learning, such as empathy, self-awareness, and self-regulation.

8. The concept of ""human-centered design"" by IDEO can be applied to the design of educational software by creating an environment that is centered around the needs and experiences of students, and that is designed to promote their well-being and success.

9. The concept of ""design thinking"" by Tim Brown can be applied to the design of educational software by incorporating features that promote creativity, innovation, and problem-solving.

10. The concept of "" gamification"" by Jane McGonigal can be applied to the design of educational software by incorporating game-like features that can help to promote engagement, motivation, and fun.

By incorporating these concepts and principles into the design of educational software, educators and developers can create a holistic and supportive learning environment that promotes student well-being and mental health, and that helps students to achieve their full potential.","['https://www.mdpi.com/2078-1547/13/2/58', 'https://www.routledge.com/A-New-Education-for-a-New-Economy-From-Human-Capital-to-Human-Flourishing/Gilead/p/book/9781032489803', 'https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/doi/10.7916/d8-2xkf-6j76', 'https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12124-024-09856-6', 'https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000382051', 'https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11217-022-09851-7', 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00071005.2017.1390061', 'https://www.amazon.com/Education-Human-Flourishing-Perspective-Integration/dp/0830828125', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8175826/', 'https://newprairiepress.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4208&context=aerc', 'https://erinraab.medium.com/designing-schools-for-human-flourishing-a-thriving-democracy-7db8a1eecc3b', 'https://medium.com/reenvisioned/dont-critique-envision-518784ed70b9', 'https://erinraab.medium.com/5-design-principles-of-schools-that-foster-human-flourishing-e6c654fa3522', 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/engymanee', 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13574809.2020.1727732', 'https://one.oecd.org/document/EDU/PISA/GB(2024)10/en/pdf', 'https://hsd.robbins.baylor.edu/person/karen-melton-phd', 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14606925.2019.1612574', 'https://www.highlandsolutions.com/about/mission', 'https://berniezipprich.com/category/education/', 'https://education.ohio.gov/Topics/Student-Supports/School-Wellness/School-based-Mental-Health', 'https://students-residents.aamc.org/medical-student-well-being/medical-student-well-being', 'https://www.ed.gov/raisethebar/mental-health-supports', 'https://well.wvu.edu/', 'https://extendedlearning.ubc.ca/courses/student-well-being-mental-health-resiliency/0211', 'https://www.madison.k12.wi.us/mental-health-wellbeing', 'https://www.doe.mass.edu/grants/2022/613-311-332/', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4885556/', 'https://youth.gov/youth-topics/youth-mental-health/school-based', 'https://wvde.us/student-support-well-being/']",education

"By the Greek word paradigm (example) we mean a pattern or example to be followed in a given situation. The American physicist and philosopher Thomas Samuel Kuhn (1922-1996) defines paradigms as “scientific advances that generate models that, for a period of time, guide the subsequent development of research that provides solutions to the problems presented.” The educational paradigm is a model used in education and aims to find the most appropriate way to teach the new generations, which differs from that of the previous generations.
In his nineteenth-century magnum opus, Arthur Schopenhauer notes the idea that all truths go through three stages: in the first they are met with ridicule, in the second they encounter violent resistance, and in the third they are accepted. Decades later, and not entirely unrelated, H.F. Lovecraft for the first time defines the fear of the unknown as a fundamental fear, seeing it as the oldest and strongest of all fears.
The lifespan of all readers of this review, regardless of their generational affiliation, is characterized by daily radical changes and re-reminders of the views of these thinkers. Inevitably, one of the most vivid examples of the rise of the new and the unknown is the dizzying advances in information technology and digital transformation. In the era of technocapitalism and accelerating globalization, digitalization is increasingly being treated as a paradigm for reformulating human value systems and needs. In that sense, the digital transformation in the field of education is a paradigm of teaching reforms and an answer to the question of how to learn in the future.
The recently adopted educational reforms, which go beyond the “one subject-one textbook” principle and instead provide for the practice of open educational resources and the transition of didactic materials from printed to digital format, probably confirm the mentioned philosophical insights. The reactions of resistance, directed mainly to the digitalization of textbooks, are numerous and, of course, expected and understandable: finally, this reform is deep and far-reaching and with its sharpness and novelty undermines the traditional way of learning for decades based in our educational worldview. However, although some of the criticisms must be considered as a quality introduction to a constructive discussion on the digitalization of textbooks, many of the reactions come down to emotional tirades without much argument.
However, the efforts to refute and reason the unargued reactions must start with a reasoned approach and proven and solid postulates, because only in this way these modern and extremely positive educational reforms will gain legitimacy before the citizens who are affected. In that direction, it is necessary for the entire planning process to be realized with a multi-perspective approach.
The Ministry of Education and Science should present a detailed assessment of the envisaged technical and infrastructural challenges and concrete proposals for overcoming them. At the same time, a sound plan is needed for the dynamics of the implementation of this reform. Of course, the support of teachers is of great importance in this process, who, as direct implementers of change, should be provided with adequate preparation and training for professional development, including the reform of the relevant university curricula for the education of future teachers.
These goals are high and, in order to achieve them, the Government of the Republic of Northern Macedonia will have to offer more than declarative support for the reforms in the overall education. The fact that, according to a number of measurable indicators, the country has one of the lowest budgeted education systems in Europe, and arguably the most unfavorable results in international testing, is a sufficient indicator of the level of commitment required in primary, secondary and higher education. to increase confidence in progressive change and to more easily see all the benefits that modernization brings.

The recently adopted educational reforms, which go beyond the “one subject-one textbook” principle and instead provide for the practice of open educational resources and the transition of didactic materials from printed to digital format, probably confirm the mentioned philosophical insights. The reactions of resistance, directed mainly to the digitalization of textbooks, are numerous and, of course, expected and understandable: finally, this reform is deep and far-reaching and with its sharpness and novelty undermines the traditional way of learning for decades based in our educational worldview. However, although some of the criticisms must be considered as a quality introduction to a constructive discussion on the digitalization of textbooks, many of the reactions come down to emotional tirades without much argument.
However, the efforts to refute and reason the unargued reactions must start with a reasoned approach and proven and solid postulates, because only in this way these modern and extremely positive educational reforms will gain legitimacy before the citizens who are affected. In that direction, it is necessary for the entire planning process to be realized with a multi-perspective approach.
The Ministry of Education and Science should present a detailed assessment of the envisaged technical and infrastructural challenges and concrete proposals for overcoming them. At the same time, a sound plan is needed for the dynamics of the implementation of this reform. Of course, the support of teachers is of great importance in this process, who, as direct implementers of change, should be provided with adequate preparation and training for professional development, including the reform of the relevant university curricula for the education of future teachers.
These goals are high and, in order to achieve them, the Government of the Republic of Northern Macedonia will have to offer more than declarative support for the reforms in the overall education. The fact that, according to a number of measurable indicators, the country has one of the lowest budgeted education systems in Europe, and arguably the most unfavorable results in international testing, is a sufficient indicator of the level of commitment required in primary, secondary and higher education. to increase confidence in progressive change and to more easily see all the benefits that modernization brings.

"By the Greek word paradigm (example) we mean a pattern or example to be followed in a given situation. The American physicist and philosopher Thomas Samuel Kuhn (1922-1996) defines paradigms as “scientific advances that generate models that, for a period of time, guide the subsequent development of research that provides solutions to the problems presented.” The educational paradigm is a model used in education and aims to find the most appropriate way to teach the new generations, which differs from that of the previous generations.
In his nineteenth-century magnum opus, Arthur Schopenhauer notes the idea that all truths go through three stages: in the first they are met with ridicule, in the second they encounter violent resistance, and in the third they are accepted.

"This discussion group will look at some of the questions we need to ask ourselves to evaluate the use of technology in the classroom and ensure that it is used to enhance teaching practice and improve the education of students.
All too often, the tools of educational technology are used to ‘drive‘ and define the educational enterprise. We use tools because we can and are expected to, rather than because they help us meet educational objectives. The means become the end. This workshop will, through its participants, identify and offer an educational critique of some current uses of technology. It will first ask participants to identify some examples of educational technology use. Then, in small groups, participants will develop some educational tasks with specified objectives, assumptions and learning outcomes, together with the technological tools that could be used to assist in this. We will then analyze and discuss these, paying particular attention to educational rationales for using the technology and the real contributions it can make to learning. The ultimate purpose is to develop simple classification systems designed to help educators make well-informed judgements of the educational value in using technology.
How is technology changing the way teachers teach and children learn in our schools today? What skills does a teacher need in this new technological world? Do we need to teach any facts when we can “Google” and find out anything we need to know in an instant? Mobile phones are computers with cameras, voice recorders, web browsers, radios, audio players, organisers, etc. Should school students be using them in class? And what about exams, should students be able to use computers in all exams?
This interactive workshop will give participants the opportunity to discuss these questions, to consider how technology is changing education and examine its impact on our schools.
Claude Alvares will take a two-hour interactive workshop on “Nurturing Creativity”. A fixed, unchanging curriculum (and hidden curriculum) requires certain things to be “done” to the student. The teacher is appointed to ensure that the content of the curriculum is somehow lodged into the students’ heads. A successful teacher for any school administration is anyone who can do this task most effectively. However, creativity by definition deals with open-ended ideas and concepts. This naturally is in huge conflict with pre-set courses and content where creativity is at a minimum since the task demanded is comprehension and retention (mugging, if we are to speak frankly). The formal school today is criticised – and rightly so – for killing creativity. Since a large number of youngsters are involved, creativity gets a bashing on a colossal scale. Teachers claim that they have no time for creativity issues since the business of education is certification. Schools certify acquisition of knowledge and have no scope for creating new knowledge. The challenge is: Can schools nurture creativity and how? Will schools always kill creativity because this is the way they are organised to function or is there a chance that we can ensure transmission of necessary social knowledge and skills while protecting and nurturing the creative mind?
Why am I learning? Why do I have to go to school? Have you ever asked yourselves these questions or heard your children ask you? Often parents, at a loss for words, may respond and say, “because everyone goes to school.” At TNS, the staff dissects these questions and gives children an opportunity to be involved in and, to some extent ‘direct‘ their own learning and apply it in meaningful ways. Through class videos and portfolios of real work, we will see constructivism at work and an opportunity to learn some of the basics of project-based learning to get you started within your own classroom, school or community. Two of TNS’s past projects will be highlighted and there will be videos demonstrating teaching and learning. Challenges of project-based learning will be highlighted to help participants understand and hopefully avoid obvious pitfalls.
What is child initiated inquiry learning? How can children direct their own learning? How do we as teachers provide an environment to facilitate, maintain and extend inquiry? What is the role of the teacher? We will discuss how building on the strengths and interests of children in inquiry enables effective cross-curricular links. How is learning contextualised and made meaningful across subject “areas”? During this workshop we will discuss and share examples of inquiry learning and how it can be documented through group and individual narrative assessments (or learning stories) in order to celebrate and share learning and development with children and their parents.","How can we effectively integrate technology to enhance student learning outcomes in an era where traditional teaching methods are no longer effective, yet the emphasis on standardized testing remains a pressing concern in many educational systems?","To effectively integrate technology to enhance student learning outcomes, it's essential to consider multiple perspectives and approaches. The search results highlight various ways to incorporate technology in education, from using virtual field trips to encouraging individual student blogging. Additionally, the benefits of integrating technology in education are numerous, including increased engagement, personalized learning, and improved collaboration. However, there are also challenges to consider, such as technology misuse, budget constraints, and insufficient training. To overcome these challenges, it's crucial to provide teachers with adequate support and resources, as well as to ensure that technology is used in a way that is aligned with educational goals and values.","['https://drexel.edu/soe/resources/student-teaching/advice/how-to-use-technology-in-the-classroom/', 'https://www.goguardian.com/blog/9-unique-ways-to-use-technology-in-the-classroom', 'https://www.edutopia.org/technology-integration-guide-implementation', 'https://www.i3-technologies.com/en/blog/stories/education/10-ways-to-use-technology-in-the-classroom/', 'https://www.vivi.io/how-to-integrate-technology-in-the-classroom/', 'https://www.prodigygame.com/main-en/blog/25-easy-ways-to-use-technology-in-the-classroom--downloadable-list/', 'https://online.lsu.edu/newsroom/articles/future-education-integrating-technology-classroom/', 'https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/5-ways-integrate-technology-preschool-michael-hilkemeijer', 'https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2019/01/29/14-practical-ways-to-integrate-technology-into-the-classroom/', 'https://www.quora.com/How-can-teachers-integrate-technology-into-their-classrooms-Is-there-a-difference-between-using-technology-and-integrating-it-into-teaching-strategies-What-are-the-benefits-of-integrating-technology-into-teaching', 'https://www.waldenu.edu/programs/education/resource/top-five-benefits-of-technology-in-the-classroom', 'https://www.teachhub.com/technology-in-the-classroom/2019/11/benefits-of-technology-in-the-classroom/', 'https://www.gcu.edu/blog/teaching-school-administration/how-using-technology-teaching-affects-classrooms', 'https://drexel.edu/soe/resources/student-teaching/advice/how-to-use-technology-in-the-classroom/', 'https://lumenlearning.com/technology-in-the-classroom/', 'https://edtechmagazine.com/k12/article/2022/09/benefits-integrating-technology-todays-k-12-classrooms-perfcon', 'https://www.viewsonic.com/library/education/5-benefits-of-technology-in-the-classroom/', 'https://soeonline.american.edu/blog/technology-in-education/', 'https://elearningindustry.com/benefits-technology-integration-education-sphere', 'https://chargetech.com/blogs/blog/10-benefits-of-using-technology-in-the-classroom', 'https://www.goguardian.com/blog/technology-in-the-classroom-importance-challenges', 'https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED577147.pdf', 'https://www.hmhco.com/blog/barriers-of-ict-in-education', 'https://insights.samsung.com/2023/07/24/5-challenges-with-technology-in-the-classroom-and-how-to-overcome-them-2/', 'https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332056490_Challenges_in_Integrating_Technology_into_Education', 'https://www.edweek.org/technology/5-big-technology-challenges-teachers-and-administrators-will-face-this-school-year/2022/08', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0883035524000661', 'https://soeonline.american.edu/blog/technology-in-education/', 'https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-tackle-top-10-challenges-educational-technology-teaching-jain', 'https://varthana.com/school/technology-in-education-benefits-and-challenges/']",education
"This discussion group will look at some of the questions we need to ask ourselves to evaluate the use of technology in the classroom and ensure that it is used to enhance teaching practice and improve the education of students.
All too often, the tools of educational technology are used to ‘drive‘ and define the educational enterprise. We use tools because we can and are expected to, rather than because they help us meet educational objectives. The means become the end. This workshop will, through its participants, identify and offer an educational critique of some current uses of technology. It will first ask participants to identify some examples of educational technology use. Then, in small groups, participants will develop some educational tasks with specified objectives, assumptions and learning outcomes, together with the technological tools that could be used to assist in this. We will then analyze and discuss these, paying particular attention to educational rationales for using the technology and the real contributions it can make to learning. The ultimate purpose is to develop simple classification systems designed to help educators make well-informed judgements of the educational value in using technology.
How is technology changing the way teachers teach and children learn in our schools today? What skills does a teacher need in this new technological world? Do we need to teach any facts when we can “Google” and find out anything we need to know in an instant? Mobile phones are computers with cameras, voice recorders, web browsers, radios, audio players, organisers, etc. Should school students be using them in class? And what about exams, should students be able to use computers in all exams?
This interactive workshop will give participants the opportunity to discuss these questions, to consider how technology is changing education and examine its impact on our schools.
Claude Alvares will take a two-hour interactive workshop on “Nurturing Creativity”. A fixed, unchanging curriculum (and hidden curriculum) requires certain things to be “done” to the student. The teacher is appointed to ensure that the content of the curriculum is somehow lodged into the students’ heads. A successful teacher for any school administration is anyone who can do this task most effectively. However, creativity by definition deals with open-ended ideas and concepts. This naturally is in huge conflict with pre-set courses and content where creativity is at a minimum since the task demanded is comprehension and retention (mugging, if we are to speak frankly). The formal school today is criticised – and rightly so – for killing creativity. Since a large number of youngsters are involved, creativity gets a bashing on a colossal scale. Teachers claim that they have no time for creativity issues since the business of education is certification. Schools certify acquisition of knowledge and have no scope for creating new knowledge. The challenge is: Can schools nurture creativity and how? Will schools always kill creativity because this is the way they are organised to function or is there a chance that we can ensure transmission of necessary social knowledge and skills while protecting and nurturing the creative mind?
Why am I learning? Why do I have to go to school? Have you ever asked yourselves these questions or heard your children ask you? Often parents, at a loss for words, may respond and say, “because everyone goes to school.” At TNS, the staff dissects these questions and gives children an opportunity to be involved in and, to some extent ‘direct‘ their own learning and apply it in meaningful ways. Through class videos and portfolios of real work, we will see constructivism at work and an opportunity to learn some of the basics of project-based learning to get you started within your own classroom, school or community. Two of TNS’s past projects will be highlighted and there will be videos demonstrating teaching and learning. Challenges of project-based learning will be highlighted to help participants understand and hopefully avoid obvious pitfalls.
What is child initiated inquiry learning? How can children direct their own learning? How do we as teachers provide an environment to facilitate, maintain and extend inquiry? What is the role of the teacher? We will discuss how building on the strengths and interests of children in inquiry enables effective cross-curricular links. How is learning contextualised and made meaningful across subject “areas”? During this workshop we will discuss and share examples of inquiry learning and how it can be documented through group and individual narrative assessments (or learning stories) in order to celebrate and share learning and development with children and their parents.",How can schools balance the need for valid and reliable assessments with the potential for technology-enhanced learning to promote more personalized and self-directed learning experiences?,"The final answer is:

Balancing assessments with technology-enhanced learning is a complex issue that requires a nuanced approach. Schools need to consider multiple perspectives and factors to ensure that technology is used effectively to promote personalized and self-directed learning experiences.","['https://itopia.com/balancing-traditional-teaching-methods-with-technology-integration-in-the-classroom/', 'https://drexel.edu/soe/resources/student-teaching/advice/how-to-use-technology-in-the-classroom/', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/24/opinion/ed-tech-classroom.html', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8455229/', 'https://gem-report-2023.unesco.org/technology-in-education/', 'https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2003/tech_schools/chapter7.asp', 'https://www2.ed.gov/documents/ai-report/ai-report.pdf', 'https://www.gcu.edu/blog/teaching-school-administration/how-using-technology-teaching-affects-classrooms', 'https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED577147.pdf', 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10888691.2018.1537791', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8936758/', 'https://blogs.sussex.ac.uk/tel/', 'https://itopia.com/balancing-traditional-teaching-methods-with-technology-integration-in-the-classroom/', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871187121000067', 'https://anatomypubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ase.1762', 'https://www.solutiontree.com/rebooting-assessment.html', 'https://gem-report-2023.unesco.org/technology-in-education/', 'https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/leveraging-technology-better-assessment-improved-learning-carney', 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38113912/', 'https://www2.ed.gov/documents/ai-report/ai-report.pdf', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8936758/', 'https://blogs.sussex.ac.uk/tel/', 'https://itopia.com/balancing-traditional-teaching-methods-with-technology-integration-in-the-classroom/', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871187121000067', 'https://anatomypubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ase.1762', 'https://www.solutiontree.com/rebooting-assessment.html', 'https://gem-report-2023.unesco.org/technology-in-education/', 'https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/leveraging-technology-better-assessment-improved-learning-carney', 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38113912/', 'https://www2.ed.gov/documents/ai-report/ai-report.pdf', 'https://itopia.com/balancing-traditional-teaching-methods-with-technology-integration-in-the-classroom/', 'https://drexel.edu/soe/resources/student-teaching/advice/how-to-use-technology-in-the-classroom/', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/24/opinion/ed-tech-classroom.html', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8455229/', 'https://gem-report-2023.unesco.org/technology-in-education/', 'https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2003/tech_schools/chapter7.asp', 'https://www2.ed.gov/documents/ai-report/ai-report.pdf', 'https://www.gcu.edu/blog/teaching-school-administration/how-using-technology-teaching-affects-classrooms', 'https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED577147.pdf', 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10888691.2018.1537791']",education

1. Provide guidance: Offer clear guidelines and expectations for the initiative, including the role of teachers, students, and administrators.
2. Offer resources: Provide teachers with the necessary resources, such as training, materials, and technology, to support their implementation of the initiative.
3. Encourage collaboration: Foster a culture of collaboration among teachers, students, and administrators to ensure that everyone is working together towards the same goals.
4. Monitor progress: Regularly monitor the progress of the initiative and provide feedback and support to teachers as needed.
5. Evaluate effectiveness: Evaluate the effectiveness of the initiative and make adjustments as needed to ensure that it is meeting its intended goals.

Here are some additional perspectives and a detailed breakdown:

* Teachers can play a crucial role in implementing the initiative by providing guidance and support to students, as well as by modeling inquiry-based learning themselves.
* Students can also play a key role by taking ownership of their learning and exploring real-world problems and solutions.
* Administrators can provide leadership and support to teachers and students, as well as ensure that the initiative aligns with the school's curriculum and educational objectives.
* Parents and community members can also play a role by providing support and resources to the school and by advocating for the initiative.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the steps the administration can take to support teachers in implementing the initiative:

1. Provide guidance:
	* Offer clear guidelines and expectations for the initiative, including the role of teachers, students, and administrators.
	* Provide training and support for teachers to help them understand the initiative and how to implement it effectively.
	* Encourage teachers to share their experiences and best practices with each other.
2. Offer resources:
	* Provide teachers with the necessary resources, such as training, materials, and technology, to support their implementation of the initiative.
	* Ensure that teachers have the necessary time and support to plan and implement the initiative.
	* Encourage teachers to use technology and other resources to support their teaching and learning.
3. Encourage collaboration:
	* Foster a culture of collaboration among teachers, students, and administrators to ensure that everyone is working together towards the same goals.
	* Encourage teachers to work together to plan and implement the initiative.
	* Encourage students to work together to explore real-world problems and solutions.
4. Monitor progress:
	* Regularly monitor the progress of the initiative and provide feedback and support to teachers as needed.
	* Use data and other forms of assessment to evaluate the effectiveness of the initiative.
	* Make adjustments as needed to ensure that the initiative is meeting its intended goals.
5. Evaluate effectiveness:
	* Evaluate the effectiveness of the initiative and make adjustments as needed to ensure that it is meeting its intended goals.
	* Use data and other forms of assessment to evaluate the effectiveness of the initiative.
	* Encourage teachers and students to reflect on their experiences and provide feedback on the initiative.

By following these steps, the administration can provide support to teachers and ensure that the initiative is successful in encouraging students to explore real-world problems and develop solutions through child-initiated inquiry learning.","['https://www.naeyc.org/resources/position-statements/dap/enhance-development', 'https://www2.ed.gov/admins/lead/safety/threatassessmentguide.pdf', 'https://www.naeyc.org/resources/pubs/yc/summer2022/power-playful-learning', 'http://www.usfpcl.org/', 'https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/education/articles/10.3389/feduc.2022.751801/full', 'https://www.edutopia.org/article/making-space-student-choice-preschool/', 'https://www.unicef.org/sites/default/files/2018-12/UNICEF-Lego-Foundation-Learning-through-Play.pdf', 'https://www.edutopia.org/blog/inquiry-based-learning-asking-right-questions-georgia-mathis', 'https://www.himama.com/blog/following-childrens-lead-how-to-implement-play-based-learning-in-preschool/', 'https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/opinion-ways-to-implement-restorative-practices-in-the-classroom/2020/01', 'https://www.naeyc.org/resources/position-statements/dap/enhance-development', 'https://www2.ed.gov/admins/lead/safety/threatassessmentguide.pdf', 'https://www.naeyc.org/resources/pubs/yc/summer2022/power-playful-learning', 'http://www.usfpcl.org/', 'https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/education/articles/10.3389/feduc.2022.751801/full', 'https://www.edutopia.org/article/making-space-student-choice-preschool/', 'https://www.unicef.org/sites/default/files/2018-12/UNICEF-Lego-Foundation-Learning-through-Play.pdf', 'https://www.edutopia.org/blog/inquiry-based-learning-asking-right-questions-georgia-mathis', 'https://www.himama.com/blog/following-childrens-lead-how-to-implement-play-based-learning-in-preschool/', 'https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/opinion-ways-to-implement-restorative-practices-in-the-classroom/2020/01', 'https://www.naeyc.org/resources/position-statements/dap/enhance-development', 'https://www2.ed.gov/admins/lead/safety/threatassessmentguide.pdf', 'https://www.naeyc.org/resources/pubs/yc/summer2022/power-playful-learning', 'http://www.usfpcl.org/', 'https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/education/articles/10.3389/feduc.2022.751801/full', 'https://www.edutopia.org/article/making-space-student-choice-preschool/', 'https://www.unicef.org/sites/default/files/2018-12/UNICEF-Lego-Foundation-Learning-through-Play.pdf', 'https://www.edutopia.org/blog/inquiry-based-learning-asking-right-questions-georgia-mathis', 'https://www.himama.com/blog/following-childrens-lead-how-to-implement-play-based-learning-in-preschool/', 'https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/opinion-ways-to-implement-restorative-practices-in-the-classroom/2020/01']",education

This interactive workshop will give participants the opportunity to discuss these questions, to consider how technology is changing education and examine its impact on our schools.
Claude Alvares will take a two-hour interactive workshop on “Nurturing Creativity”. A fixed, unchanging curriculum (and hidden curriculum) requires certain things to be “done” to the student. The teacher is appointed to ensure that the content of the curriculum is somehow lodged into the students’ heads. A successful teacher for any school administration is anyone who can do this task most effectively. However, creativity by definition deals with open-ended ideas and concepts. This naturally is in huge conflict with pre-set courses and content where creativity is at a minimum since the task demanded is comprehension and retention (mugging, if we are to speak frankly). The formal school today is criticised – and rightly so – for killing creativity. Since a large number of youngsters are involved, creativity gets a bashing on a colossal scale. Teachers claim that they have no time for creativity issues since the business of education is certification. Schools certify acquisition of knowledge and have no scope for creating new knowledge. The challenge is: Can schools nurture creativity and how? Will schools always kill creativity because this is the way they are organised to function or is there a chance that we can ensure transmission of necessary social knowledge and skills while protecting and nurturing the creative mind?
Why am I learning? Why do I have to go to school? Have you ever asked yourselves these questions or heard your children ask you? Often parents, at a loss for words, may respond and say, “because everyone goes to school.” At TNS, the staff dissects these questions and gives children an opportunity to be involved in and, to some extent ‘direct‘ their own learning and apply it in meaningful ways. Through class videos and portfolios of real work, we will see constructivism at work and an opportunity to learn some of the basics of project-based learning to get you started within your own classroom, school or community. Two of TNS’s past projects will be highlighted and there will be videos demonstrating teaching and learning. Challenges of project-based learning will be highlighted to help participants understand and hopefully avoid obvious pitfalls.
What is child initiated inquiry learning? How can children direct their own learning? How do we as teachers provide an environment to facilitate, maintain and extend inquiry? What is the role of the teacher? We will discuss how building on the strengths and interests of children in inquiry enables effective cross-curricular links. How is learning contextualised and made meaningful across subject “areas”? During this workshop we will discuss and share examples of inquiry learning and how it can be documented through group and individual narrative assessments (or learning stories) in order to celebrate and share learning and development with children and their parents.",How can teachers balance the need to use technology to provide personalized learning experiences with the risk of creating a sense of isolation among students who may feel that they are learning alone and not as part of a community?,"To balance the need to use technology to provide personalized learning experiences with the risk of creating a sense of isolation among students, teachers can adopt a multifaceted approach that incorporates various strategies.","['https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Artificial-Intelligence-in/Balancing-Human-Touch-with-AI-in-Education/ba-p/590952', 'https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/opinion-ways-to-implement-restorative-practices-in-the-classroom/2020/01', 'https://lumenlearning.com/technology-in-the-classroom/', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/24/opinion/ed-tech-classroom.html', 'https://itopia.com/balancing-traditional-teaching-methods-with-technology-integration-in-the-classroom/', 'https://www.commonsense.org/education/articles/screen-time-in-school-finding-the-right-balance-for-your-classroom', 'https://kappanonline.org/vaughn-making-sense-student-agency-early-grades/', 'https://www.commonsense.org/education/articles/teachers-essential-guide-to-teaching-with-technology', 'https://www.edutopia.org/article/unplugging-technology-classroom/', 'https://rossier.usc.edu/news-insights/news/seven-effective-ways-promote-equity-classroom', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/24/opinion/ed-tech-classroom.html', 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10888691.2018.1537791', 'https://www.edutopia.org/article/using-technology-support-student-engagement/', 'https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Artificial-Intelligence-in/Balancing-Human-Touch-with-AI-in-Education/ba-p/590952', 'https://www.naeyc.org/resources/position-statements/dap/principles', 'https://www.apa.org/monitor/2023/09/protecting-teens-on-social-media', 'https://drexel.edu/soe/resources/student-teaching/advice/Promote-Inclusion-in-the-Classroom/', 'https://csic.georgetown.edu/magazine/social-media-reshaping-todays-education-system/', 'https://www.pearsonhighered.com/assets/samplechapter/0/1/3/2/0132272350.pdf', 'https://www.aauw.org/resources/research/the-stem-gap/', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/24/opinion/ed-tech-classroom.html', 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10888691.2018.1537791', 'https://www.edutopia.org/article/using-technology-support-student-engagement/', 'https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Artificial-Intelligence-in/Balancing-Human-Touch-with-AI-in-Education/ba-p/590952', 'https://www.naeyc.org/resources/position-statements/dap/principles', 'https://www.apa.org/monitor/2023/09/protecting-teens-on-social-media', 'https://drexel.edu/soe/resources/student-teaching/advice/Promote-Inclusion-in-the-Classroom/', 'https://csic.georgetown.edu/magazine/social-media-reshaping-todays-education-system/', 'https://www.pearsonhighered.com/assets/samplechapter/0/1/3/2/0132272350.pdf', 'https://www.aauw.org/resources/research/the-stem-gap/']",education

"That's reassuring as an educator. And I want to turn our attention a little bit to the issue of social mobility, because and there are really good examples out there of the way that that education technology can support the development of social mobility. And have you have you got anything to share with us in terms of examples that you might have come across?
I can give a couple of so I said that we've announced some funding for grantees edtech organisations that are working in a range of different areas. I think the first point I'd make is that usually, I think technology has a role to play in tackling social mobility where it supports great teaching. So I don't think technology on its own can do this. We were talking just before we started around a school, you mentioned in Blackpool that had really embedded iPads into their learning. And I'm sure there was some fantastic programs on that iPads that children could use, that teachers could use. But I guarantee that it wasn't that alone, that it was that those iPads were helping teachers teach brilliantly saving their time, so they had more time to put to the things that really mattered. So I think when we're talking about social mobility and technology, I do think it's essential that we're looking at technology as a support for great teaching and learning. Some of the tools I would say about actually as an example for for that I think there's we're working with organisations that are one trying to tackle formative assessment. So such an important element of teaching being able to give great feedback. So I was working with a few organisations that are supporting schools to save time on their assessment but also support great feedback. People like HegartyMaths is fantastic, Seneca, Pobble. All of these are working with schools to to kind of help that teaching process. Another really key element we think, is parental engagement. We speak to schools all the time. And I know from my own work as a school governor, how difficult it is to engage with some of those hard to reach parents, parents who might be working two jobs, who don't have normal working patterns, who might have had bad experiences with the education system. And we're exploring this with several organisations that are making it much easier for parents to access to access information about the school in a more accessible way. So an example on that is free flow info. So they work in a number of schools are doing things that are really different. So just different ways of engaging different kinds of parents. So I think that's another key one. And another thing you mentioned was accessibility. So we, I think one key thing is that all technology I think we've already heard should be accessible to all students. So students with learning difficulties often are left behind from technology products, which don't see it as their top priority. And I think it should be it should be a priority for every single technology product out there. And schools and people like us should be pushing them further to make sure that that is a key priority. And somebody who's here today actually, mangahigh, a maths assessment tool, and we're supporting them with some funding to make sure that everything that they have on offer can be ready and available for SEND schools. So a few examples, not too many plugs, I hope, some helpful advice as well.

Professor David Brown","Can you explain how the integration of assessment for learning and assessment of learning can help bridge the gap in educational outcomes for disadvantaged students, and what role education technology can play in supporting this approach in higher education?","To bridge the gap in educational outcomes for disadvantaged students, it's essential to integrate assessment for learning and assessment of learning in higher education. This integration can help identify areas where students need additional support, allowing educators to provide targeted interventions and resources.

The integration of assessment for learning and assessment of learning can help bridge the gap in educational outcomes for disadvantaged students by:

1. Identifying areas where students need additional support: By assessing students' understanding and progress, educators can identify areas where students need additional support, allowing them to provide targeted interventions and resources.
2. Providing targeted interventions and resources: By providing targeted interventions and resources, educators can help students overcome specific challenges and improve their learning outcomes.
3. Encouraging student self-assessment: By encouraging students to self-assess their understanding and progress, educators can help students take ownership of their learning and develop a growth mindset.
4. Fostering a culture of continuous improvement: By integrating assessment for learning and assessment of learning, educators can foster a culture of continuous improvement, where students and educators work together to improve learning outcomes.

Education technology can play a significant role in supporting the integration of assessment for learning and assessment of learning in higher education by:

1. Providing digital tools for assessment and feedback: Education technology can provide digital tools for assessment and feedback, allowing educators to quickly and easily assess student understanding and provide feedback.
2. Facilitating student self-assessment: Education technology can facilitate student self-assessment by providing digital tools and platforms for students to reflect on their own learning and progress.
3. Enhancing teacher-student interaction: Education technology can enhance teacher-student interaction by providing digital tools and platforms for teachers to communicate with students and provide feedback.
4. Improving data analysis and reporting: Education technology can improve data analysis and reporting by providing digital tools and platforms for educators to analyze and report on student data.

Some examples of education technology that can support the integration of assessment for learning and assessment of learning include:

1. Learning management systems (LMS): LMS can provide digital tools and platforms for assessment and feedback, as well as facilitate student self-assessment and teacher-student interaction.
2. Educational software: Educational software can provide digital tools and platforms for assessment and feedback, as well as facilitate student self-assessment and teacher-student interaction.
3. Online assessment platforms: Online assessment platforms can provide digital tools and platforms for assessment and feedback, as well as facilitate student self-assessment and teacher-student interaction.
4. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) tools: AI and ML tools can provide digital tools and platforms for assessment and feedback, as well as facilitate student self-assessment and teacher-student interaction.

Overall, the integration of assessment for learning and assessment of learning in higher education can help bridge the gap in educational outcomes for disadvantaged students by providing targeted interventions and resources, encouraging student self-assessment, and fostering a culture of continuous improvement. Education technology can play a significant role in supporting this integration by providing digital tools and platforms for assessment and feedback, facilitating student self-assessment, enhancing teacher-student interaction, and improving data analysis and reporting.","['https://www.pearsonassessments.com/professional-assessments/blog-webinars/blog/2017/12/assessment-for-learning-vs--assessment-of-learning.html', 'https://wegrowteachers.com/the-difference-between-assessment-of-learning-and-assessment-for-learning/', 'http://www.taotesting.com/blog/assessment-for-learning-vs-of-learning-explained/', 'https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/assessment-learning-need-framework-rajat-agrawal', 'https://www.harapnuik.org/?p=8475', 'https://www.aleks.com/', 'https://cambridge-community.org.uk/professional-development/gswafl/index.html', 'https://resourcecentre.savethechildren.net/document/remote-assessment-of-learning-real-toolkit/', 'https://educationstandards.nsw.edu.au/wps/portal/nesa/k-10/understanding-the-curriculum/assessment/approaches', 'https://resourcecentre.savethechildren.net/document/holistic-assessment-of-learning-and-development-outcomes-haldo-administration-and-adaptation-guidance-external-partners-email-learningassessmentsavechildren-org/', 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10888691.2018.1537791', 'https://learningpolicyinstitute.org/sites/default/files/product-files/Equity_ESSA_REPORT.pdf', 'https://educationnorthwest.org/sites/default/files/resources/culturally-responsive-teaching.pdf', 'https://www.edutopia.org/blog/art-education-closing-achievement-gap-anne-obrien', 'https://gem-report-2023.unesco.org/technology-in-education/', 'https://one.oecd.org/document/EDU/WKP(2023)14/en/pdf', 'https://tcf.org/content/facts/the-benefits-of-socioeconomically-and-racially-integrated-schools-and-classrooms/', 'https://www.aacnnursing.org/Portals/0/PDFs/Publications/Essentials-2021.pdf', 'https://nces.ed.gov/npec/pdf/kuh_team_report.pdf', 'https://www.oecd.org/en/about/directorates/directorate-for-education-and-skills.html', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9514973/', 'https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2003/tech_schools/chapter7.asp', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9257720/', 'https://poorvucenter.yale.edu/Formative-Summative-Assessments', 'https://educationaltechnologyjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41239-023-00408-3', 'https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2024/04/future-learning-ai-revolutionizing-education-4-0/', 'https://www2.ed.gov/documents/ai-report/ai-report.pdf', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0742051X18321942', 'https://educationaltechnologyjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41239-023-00411-8', 'https://www.buffalo.edu/catt/teach/develop/theory/constructivism.html']",education
"That's reassuring as an educator. And I want to turn our attention a little bit to the issue of social mobility, because and there are really good examples out there of the way that that education technology can support the development of social mobility. And have you have you got anything to share with us in terms of examples that you might have come across?
I can give a couple of so I said that we've announced some funding for grantees edtech organisations that are working in a range of different areas. I think the first point I'd make is that usually, I think technology has a role to play in tackling social mobility where it supports great teaching. So I don't think technology on its own can do this. We were talking just before we started around a school, you mentioned in Blackpool that had really embedded iPads into their learning. And I'm sure there was some fantastic programs on that iPads that children could use, that teachers could use. But I guarantee that it wasn't that alone, that it was that those iPads were helping teachers teach brilliantly saving their time, so they had more time to put to the things that really mattered. So I think when we're talking about social mobility and technology, I do think it's essential that we're looking at technology as a support for great teaching and learning. Some of the tools I would say about actually as an example for for that I think there's we're working with organisations that are one trying to tackle formative assessment. So such an important element of teaching being able to give great feedback. So I was working with a few organisations that are supporting schools to save time on their assessment but also support great feedback. People like HegartyMaths is fantastic, Seneca, Pobble. All of these are working with schools to to kind of help that teaching process. Another really key element we think, is parental engagement. We speak to schools all the time. And I know from my own work as a school governor, how difficult it is to engage with some of those hard to reach parents, parents who might be working two jobs, who don't have normal working patterns, who might have had bad experiences with the education system. And we're exploring this with several organisations that are making it much easier for parents to access to access information about the school in a more accessible way. So an example on that is free flow info. So they work in a number of schools are doing things that are really different. So just different ways of engaging different kinds of parents. So I think that's another key one. And another thing you mentioned was accessibility. So we, I think one key thing is that all technology I think we've already heard should be accessible to all students. So students with learning difficulties often are left behind from technology products, which don't see it as their top priority. And I think it should be it should be a priority for every single technology product out there. And schools and people like us should be pushing them further to make sure that that is a key priority. And somebody who's here today actually, mangahigh, a maths assessment tool, and we're supporting them with some funding to make sure that everything that they have on offer can be ready and available for SEND schools. So a few examples, not too many plugs, I hope, some helpful advice as well.
Great. And obviously, you know, issues around social mobility, don't stop at the end of key stage four, you know, there will be same sort of issues in higher education whatsoever. How are you using technology to be able to support pupils who are disadvantaged in higher education?

Professor David Brown","How might the use of virtual reality technology in education benefit students with speech and language impairments, and what potential challenges or limitations would you anticipate in implementing this technology in a mainstream classroom?","The benefits of using virtual reality technology in education for students with speech and language impairments include increased engagement, improved communication skills, and enhanced learning experiences. VR can also help students with visual impairments, autism spectrum disorder, and other disabilities access educational content and overcome communication barriers.

However, there are potential challenges and limitations to implementing VR technology in mainstream classrooms for students with speech and language impairments. These include:

1. Accessibility and scalability: VR technology may not be accessible to all students, particularly those with severe disabilities or limited mobility.
2. Cost: VR equipment and software can be expensive, making it difficult for schools to implement and maintain.
3. Integration: VR technology may require significant changes to existing teaching practices and classroom infrastructure.
4. Training: Teachers may need additional training to effectively integrate VR technology into their teaching practices.
5. Technical issues: VR technology can be prone to technical issues, such as equipment malfunctions or connectivity problems.

To overcome these challenges, educators can use the following strategies:

1. Provide accessibility features: Ensure that VR technology is accessible to all students, including those with disabilities.
2. Offer training and support: Provide teachers with training and support to effectively integrate VR technology into their teaching practices.
3. Integrate with existing curriculum: Integrate VR technology with existing curriculum and teaching practices to minimize disruption.
4. Monitor and evaluate: Monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of VR technology in improving student outcomes and make adjustments as needed.
5. Collaborate with experts: Collaborate with experts in special education and VR technology to ensure that the implementation is effective and accessible.

By understanding the benefits and challenges of using VR technology in education for students with speech and language impairments, educators can develop effective strategies to support these students and improve their learning outcomes.","['https://www.cahelp.org/cahelpenews/v_r_and_a_r_in_special_education', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9137951/', 'https://elearningindustry.com/immersive-learning-how-virtual-and-augmented-reality-transforming-higher-education', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10047908/', 'https://soeonline.american.edu/blog/benefits-of-virtual-reality-in-education/', 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0144929X.2024.2304607', 'https://rehab.jmir.org/2023/1/e46959', 'https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7102/14/4/365', 'https://www.facultyfocus.com/articles/equality-inclusion-and-diversity/a-multipronged-approach-to-harnessing-virtual-reality-to-advance-the-hbcu-mission/', 'https://online.utpb.edu/about-us/articles/education/the-use-of-technology-in-special-education', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10047908/', 'https://soeonline.american.edu/blog/assistive-technology-in-the-classroom/', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9137951/', 'https://www.adcet.edu.au/inclusive-teaching/specific-disabilities/blind-vision-impaired', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590291123001377', 'https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5c6eb77340f0b647b214c599/374_Implementing_Inclusive_Education.pdf', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S294967802300017X', 'https://www2.ed.gov/documents/students/supporting-child-student-social-emotional-behavioral-mental-health.pdf', 'https://equalentry.com/how-can-a-blind-person-use-virtual-reality/', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/up7ko7/reasons_why_virtual_reality_has_not_changed_the/', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10047908/', 'https://www.adcet.edu.au/inclusive-teaching/specific-disabilities/blind-vision-impaired', 'https://www.ldrfa.org/incorporate-assistive-technology/', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8115541/', 'https://www.clarkeschools.org/', 'https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1412178.pdf', 'https://www.stutteringhelp.org/content/one-clutterer-another%E2%80%A6-strategies-helped-me', 'https://ospi.k12.wa.us/sites/default/files/2023-08/wastatemultilinguallearnerpoliciespracticesguide.pdf', 'https://sites.ed.gov/idea/topic-areas/', 'https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5c6eb77340f0b647b214c599/374_Implementing_Inclusive_Education.pdf']",education
"UNESCO data show that 20% of children ages 6 to 11 are out of school, and 60% of those above age 15 are excluded from the educational system. Many school systems have fees that are burdensome for families which, according to the World Bank, can lead to further exclusion. Students in rural areas face even more challenges: schools are harder to access, tend to have less infrastructure, and have fewer well-trained teachers. Sub-Saharan Africa is also host to a dazzling array of languages, which makes creating quality curricula a challenge.
Despite these challenges, this region is filled with driven innovators who recognise that access to quality education is a form of empowerment for both the children they help and the communities those children are in. Among the 2024 Global Collection, ACE Radio School, Shupavu291, TAW Academy’s Board Games, and Chalkboard Guides stand out as examples of how barriers can be broken down, education can be democratized, communities can be strengthened, and gaps can be bridged by using precisely chosen initiatives that are cost effective and respect local knowledge. So how can we leverage everyday tools - a radio, a text message, a chalkboard and a board game - to make a big impact?
Breaking Down Barriers
Eno Simon, Head of Office at ACE Charities, shows how the barriers to education can compound: “Nigeria has the highest rate of out-of-school children in the world. They’re out of school for so many reasons.… Even if you have traditional classroom education, families cannot pay the fees. They don’t feel safe letting their children go to school, and even when they get to school, sometimes you have poorly motivated teachers who don’t show up. And sometimes you don’t even have the resources.” Her team considered ways to make education accessible even in the face of these challenges. They needed an innovation that made quality education available - even free - to students while in the safety of their own homes.
ACE lessons take place in local communities and in local languages
Their solution? ACE Radio School, which brings school to their students, honouring their situations and giving them a space to continue their education. Eno explains: “We have provided access to quality learning that is free and safe because it happens in their local community, accessible by radio. Everybody has radio, even parents with regular phones have the radio component so they can access learning in their local languages.” The programme, which airs three times a week across four radio stations, hires teachers from the top private schools to formulate the lessons and has furnished education to nearly 36,000 students across 10 states.
But Eno emphasises that radio lessons are an opening: “We find an increased interest in formal education. Some people have been to school but they dropped out… But when the experience is radio school, it inspires their interest to go back to school.”
Of course, students who are in school need support as well. While teacher training improves, Shupavu291 and Chalkboard Guides take two different paths to democratising education.
In Kenya, mobile phone subscriptions are quite common - as of 2021 there are 1.25 mobile phone accounts per resident. Eneza Education realised that this could be an easy way to provide tutoring and educational content at low cost to their users. They paired with Safaricom to create Shupavu291, a mobile learning platform accessible entirely through SMS, with lessons, quizzes and assignments aligned to the Kenyan national curriculum. But they also have access to much broader support: students are matched to teachers who respond in real-time to their questions, and they can access Wikipedia by texting the platform for more information. The scale of this innovation is staggering: they have already delivered nearly 80 million lessons and the students who engage with them perform 23% higher on tests.
Lessons from Chalkboard Guides are rigorous and easy to follow for teachers and students
Shupavu291 provides students with high quality tutoring on demand. Chalkboard Guides, on the other hand, works to make classroom teaching more effective. Justice Rising’s Chief Technical Officer Ee-Reh Owo shares why an intervention in teaching methods is urgent: “It's well-known that too many children are not achieving basic literacy and numeracy. But in Sub-Saharan Africa, where according to the World Bank, 89% of 10 year olds cannot read and understand a simple text, students in conflict zones learn six times slower than even their peers who are affected by other types of crisis.” Justice Rising found that structured pedagogy solutions based on best practices were impactful in improving educational outcomes, but teachers did not have the bandwidth to properly implement them. Chalkboard Guides was developed with an eye to Cognitive Load Theory, which stresses the importance of predictable routines and learning in manageable chunks, especially during stressful situations.","Can you suggest ways to incentivize students to participate in online discussions and peer-to-peer learning activities in a rural community with limited access to digital infrastructure, where a new educational initiative is being launched?","To incentivize students to participate in online discussions and peer-to-peer learning activities in a rural community with limited access to digital infrastructure, we can consider the following strategies:

1. Provide incentives for participation, such as rewards or recognition for active engagement.
2. Foster a sense of community and belonging among students by creating a welcoming and inclusive online environment.
3. Offer flexible and accessible learning opportunities that cater to the unique needs and circumstances of rural students.
4. Encourage peer-to-peer learning and support by providing opportunities for students to work together on projects and share their experiences.
5. Provide training and support for teachers and educators to effectively facilitate online discussions and peer-to-peer learning activities.
6. Utilize mobile devices and other digital tools to provide access to online learning opportunities, even in areas with limited internet connectivity.
7. Offer incentives for students to participate in online discussions and peer-to-peer learning activities, such as extra credit or special privileges.
8. Create a sense of ownership and responsibility among students by giving them a voice in the design and implementation of online learning activities.
9. Provide opportunities for students to reflect on their learning and share their experiences with others, which can help to build a sense of community and motivation.
10. Utilize social media and other digital platforms to promote online learning opportunities and encourage student participation.

By considering these strategies, we can create an environment that is conducive to student participation and engagement in online discussions and peer-to-peer learning activities, even in rural communities with limited access to digital infrastructure.","['http://henryjenkins.org/blog/2006/10/confronting_the_challenges_of.html', 'https://youth.gov/youth-topics/involving-youth-positive-youth-development', 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10888691.2018.1537791', 'https://www2.ed.gov/rschstat/eval/tech/evidence-based-practices/finalreport.pdf', 'https://nces.ed.gov/npec/pdf/kuh_team_report.pdf', 'https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/journey-advocacy-action-through-empowering-inclusive-grace-nasimiyu-quakf', 'https://www.nysed.gov/sites/default/files/programs/crs/culturally-responsive-sustaining-education-framework.pdf', 'https://ctb.ku.edu/en/table-of-contents/implement/enhancing-support/peer-support-groups/main', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK573912/', 'https://store.samhsa.gov/sites/default/files/pep22-06-01-005.pdf', 'http://henryjenkins.org/blog/2006/10/confronting_the_challenges_of.html', 'https://youth.gov/youth-topics/involving-youth-positive-youth-development', 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10888691.2018.1537791', 'https://www2.ed.gov/rschstat/eval/tech/evidence-based-practices/finalreport.pdf', 'https://nces.ed.gov/npec/pdf/kuh_team_report.pdf', 'https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/journey-advocacy-action-through-empowering-inclusive-grace-nasimiyu-quakf', 'https://www.nysed.gov/sites/default/files/programs/crs/culturally-responsive-sustaining-education-framework.pdf', 'https://ctb.ku.edu/en/table-of-contents/implement/enhancing-support/peer-support-groups/main', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK573912/', 'https://store.samhsa.gov/sites/default/files/pep22-06-01-005.pdf']",education

"UNESCO data show that 20% of children ages 6 to 11 are out of school, and 60% of those above age 15 are excluded from the educational system. Many school systems have fees that are burdensome for families which, according to the World Bank, can lead to further exclusion. Students in rural areas face even more challenges: schools are harder to access, tend to have less infrastructure, and have fewer well-trained teachers. Sub-Saharan Africa is also host to a dazzling array of languages, which makes creating quality curricula a challenge.
Despite these challenges, this region is filled with driven innovators who recognise that access to quality education is a form of empowerment for both the children they help and the communities those children are in. Among the 2024 Global Collection, ACE Radio School, Shupavu291, TAW Academy’s Board Games, and Chalkboard Guides stand out as examples of how barriers can be broken down, education can be democratized, communities can be strengthened, and gaps can be bridged by using precisely chosen initiatives that are cost effective and respect local knowledge. So how can we leverage everyday tools - a radio, a text message, a chalkboard and a board game - to make a big impact?
Breaking Down Barriers
Eno Simon, Head of Office at ACE Charities, shows how the barriers to education can compound: “Nigeria has the highest rate of out-of-school children in the world. They’re out of school for so many reasons.… Even if you have traditional classroom education, families cannot pay the fees. They don’t feel safe letting their children go to school, and even when they get to school, sometimes you have poorly motivated teachers who don’t show up. And sometimes you don’t even have the resources.” Her team considered ways to make education accessible even in the face of these challenges. They needed an innovation that made quality education available - even free - to students while in the safety of their own homes.
ACE lessons take place in local communities and in local languages
Their solution? ACE Radio School, which brings school to their students, honouring their situations and giving them a space to continue their education. Eno explains: “We have provided access to quality learning that is free and safe because it happens in their local community, accessible by radio. Everybody has radio, even parents with regular phones have the radio component so they can access learning in their local languages.” The programme, which airs three times a week across four radio stations, hires teachers from the top private schools to formulate the lessons and has furnished education to nearly 36,000 students across 10 states.
But Eno emphasises that radio lessons are an opening: “We find an increased interest in formal education. Some people have been to school but they dropped out… But when the experience is radio school, it inspires their interest to go back to school.”
Of course, students who are in school need support as well. While teacher training improves, Shupavu291 and Chalkboard Guides take two different paths to democratising education.
In Kenya, mobile phone subscriptions are quite common - as of 2021 there are 1.25 mobile phone accounts per resident. Eneza Education realised that this could be an easy way to provide tutoring and educational content at low cost to their users. They paired with Safaricom to create Shupavu291, a mobile learning platform accessible entirely through SMS, with lessons, quizzes and assignments aligned to the Kenyan national curriculum. But they also have access to much broader support: students are matched to teachers who respond in real-time to their questions, and they can access Wikipedia by texting the platform for more information. The scale of this innovation is staggering: they have already delivered nearly 80 million lessons and the students who engage with them perform 23% higher on tests.
Lessons from Chalkboard Guides are rigorous and easy to follow for teachers and students
Shupavu291 provides students with high quality tutoring on demand. Chalkboard Guides, on the other hand, works to make classroom teaching more effective. Justice Rising’s Chief Technical Officer Ee-Reh Owo shares why an intervention in teaching methods is urgent: “It's well-known that too many children are not achieving basic literacy and numeracy.

"Professor David Brown
I think that's really true. That's a real potential downside of technology. Because every time we introduce new technology, virtual reality, AI machine learning, the money still tends to go to higher education. So I fight for money in Europe, to support technology in terms of educational technology for people with learning disabilities and autism. But still, the big money's still going to people who can afford to go to university. So social mobility in the past as we all know, was based on good education, and you can change your economic position or your social status. And when I went to university, I didn't have to take a loan. But now all of my students have to take a loan. And so what we're getting is people who can afford to pay afford to take the risk, and not people based on greatest merit. So I think it's a challenge to technologists, to create systems that are targeting people at risk of exclusion. And that's what we do. And there are good uses of virtual reality and AI, and machine learning, and you all know them. And we can also invest in good uses too. And that's what I think our aim should be, to address that point. There's a huge potential danger.
Do you want to chip in on that one?
I suppose, what I would add again, to go back to my high open, about employers have this duty to step up and get involved. And you know, thousands and thousands do is that is part of the solution. In the you know, we we spent a lot of our time encouraging our members to get involved and actually getting them to go to schools that need the help in college universities that need the help. So, you have phenomenons and I'm sorry to use a London example in Birmingham. But you know, you have a phenomenon where schools in Tower Hamlets will have bankers, accountants queuing up to help and there's a lot of their time to tell him to go away. And you then go only a half a mile down the road somewhere like Barking and there's nothing and actually it's very difficult for employers and charities to understand where are the cold spots as it were, how do you get your help to those that most needed not the ones that shout the loudest or are closest, so I was very struck actually by a speech by Damien Hinds when he when he was Secretary of State that he said that it when he first became Secretary of State, all of his civil servants planned out his diary to visit schools and colleges and all of the schools, colleges that he was visiting, were outstanding or good. And, I think there's a danger we all sort of slip into is that we will see the good, we will see the outstanding, and I hope whoever is the next Education Secretary will continue what Damien Hinds spoke about and actually commit entirely to helping the cold spots, not the official cold spots, which are somewhat arbitrary and somewhat confusing. The Northeast for instance, not having one despite having the highest of deprivation, but actually thinking about where the schools and colleges that need the most help, and how do we get the most money to them? How do we get employers to help them? And try to actually coordinate it because I, I think there is enough out there, there is you know, we spend above the average education. And we have very, very enthusiastic employers. And yet we still have disadvantaged gaps and other problems. So I think a huge part of the answers question is just better coordination, and focusing all the efforts as much as we can.","How can the government leverage technology to support the development of sustainable infrastructure in urban areas, and what role can educators play in promoting environmental literacy among students?",The government and educators can play a crucial role in promoting sustainable infrastructure development and environmental literacy in urban areas.,"['https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/01/governments-leverage-4ir-achieve-sdgs/', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/31/fact-sheet-the-american-jobs-plan/', 'https://www.transportation.gov/RAISEgrants/about', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/05/20/fact-sheet-partnership-for-global-infrastructure-and-investment-at-the-g7-summit/', 'https://www.us.jll.com/en/solutions/infrastructure-advisory-services', 'https://www.trade.gov/country-commercial-guides/norway-green-technologies', 'https://www.sanjoseca.gov/your-government/departments-offices/information-technology/smart-city-vision', 'https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/investments-into-the-sustainability-transition', 'https://www.cisa.gov/topics/risk-management/connected-communities', 'https://www.idc.com/prodserv/insights/government/smart-cities-awards', 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00958964.2014.999742', 'https://thewatershed.org/environmental-education/', 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13504622.2014.966656', 'https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/pl/environliteracyblueprint.asp', 'https://www.noaa.gov/office-education/elp', 'https://joegardener.com/podcast/environmental-literacy-public-education/', 'https://www.stmarys-ca.edu/centers-institutes/center-environmental-literacy/river-of-words', 'https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/wallerstein/services/projects-and-programs/new-york-state-environmental-literacy-plan', 'https://naaee.org/node/1', 'https://www.smcoe.org/for-schools/environmental-literacy/', 'https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/01/governments-leverage-4ir-achieve-sdgs/', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/31/fact-sheet-the-american-jobs-plan/', 'https://www.transportation.gov/RAISEgrants/about', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/05/20/fact-sheet-partnership-for-global-infrastructure-and-investment-at-the-g7-summit/', 'https://www.us.jll.com/en/solutions/infrastructure-advisory-services', 'https://www.trade.gov/country-commercial-guides/norway-green-technologies', 'https://www.sanjoseca.gov/your-government/departments-offices/information-technology/smart-city-vision', 'https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/investments-into-the-sustainability-transition', 'https://www.cisa.gov/topics/risk-management/connected-communities', 'https://www.idc.com/prodserv/insights/government/smart-cities-awards', 'https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/01/governments-leverage-4ir-achieve-sdgs/', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/31/fact-sheet-the-american-jobs-plan/', 'https://www.transportation.gov/RAISEgrants/about', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/05/20/fact-sheet-partnership-for-global-infrastructure-and-investment-at-the-g7-summit/', 'https://www.us.jll.com/en/solutions/infrastructure-advisory-services', 'https://www.trade.gov/country-commercial-guides/norway-green-technologies', 'https://www.sanjoseca.gov/your-government/departments-offices/information-technology/smart-city-vision', 'https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/investments-into-the-sustainability-transition', 'https://www.cisa.gov/topics/risk-management/connected-communities', 'https://www.idc.com/prodserv/insights/government/smart-cities-awards']",education

I think that's really true. That's a real potential downside of technology. Because every time we introduce new technology, virtual reality, AI machine learning, the money still tends to go to higher education. So I fight for money in Europe, to support technology in terms of educational technology for people with learning disabilities and autism. But still, the big money's still going to people who can afford to go to university. So social mobility in the past as we all know, was based on good education, and you can change your economic position or your social status. And when I went to university, I didn't have to take a loan. But now all of my students have to take a loan. And so what we're getting is people who can afford to pay afford to take the risk, and not people based on greatest merit. So I think it's a challenge to technologists, to create systems that are targeting people at risk of exclusion. And that's what we do. And there are good uses of virtual reality and AI, and machine learning, and you all know them. And we can also invest in good uses too. And that's what I think our aim should be, to address that point. There's a huge potential danger.
Do you want to chip in on that one?
I suppose, what I would add again, to go back to my high open, about employers have this duty to step up and get involved. And you know, thousands and thousands do is that is part of the solution.

So, you have phenomenons and I'm sorry to use a London example in Birmingham. But you know, you have a phenomenon where schools in Tower Hamlets will have bankers, accountants queuing up to help and there's a lot of their time to tell him to go away. And you then go only a half a mile down the road somewhere like Barking and there's nothing and actually it's very difficult for employers and charities to understand where are the cold spots as it were, how do you get your help to those that most needed not the ones that shout the loudest or are closest, so I was very struck actually by a speech by Damien Hinds when he when he was Secretary of State that he said that it when he first became Secretary of State, all of his civil servants planned out his diary to visit schools and colleges and all of the schools, colleges that he was visiting, were outstanding or good. And, I think there's a danger we all sort of slip into is that we will see the good, we will see the outstanding, and I hope whoever is the next Education Secretary will continue what Damien Hinds spoke about and actually commit entirely to helping the cold spots, not the official cold spots, which are somewhat arbitrary and somewhat confusing.

This can be achieved by providing universities with the necessary resources and support to make informed decisions, while also establishing clear guidelines and standards to ensure accountability.

Here are some potential strategies to promote autonomy and accountability in universities:

1. Provide universities with more autonomy in decision-making, such as budgeting and curriculum development, while also establishing clear guidelines and standards to ensure accountability.
2. Encourage universities to adopt decentralized decision-making processes, such as departmental or faculty-level decision-making, while also providing support and resources to ensure that these processes are effective and efficient.
3. Establish clear and transparent accountability mechanisms, such as regular reporting and evaluation, to ensure that universities are held accountable for their decisions and actions.
4. Provide universities with the necessary resources and support to make informed decisions, such as data and analytics, while also establishing clear guidelines and standards to ensure accountability.
5. Encourage universities to adopt a culture of continuous improvement, where they regularly assess and evaluate their programs and services, and make adjustments as needed.

By implementing these strategies, a government agency can encourage universities to adopt decentralized decision-making processes while ensuring the overall quality of education.","['https://www.researchgate.net/post/How_do_you_promote_learner_autonomy_with_your_students', 'https://www.the74million.org/article/i-thought-school-autonomy-was-the-silver-bullet-for-improvement-i-was-wrong-ish/', 'https://www.uwlax.edu/catl/guides/teaching-improvement-guide/how-can-i-improve/autonomy/', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666374024000219', 'https://www.nea.org/resource-library/4-ways-increase-educator-voice-respect-and-professional-autonomy', 'https://www.eua.eu/our-work/topics/autonomy-and-governance.html', 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15326985ep3902_2', 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32541771/', 'https://www.gse.harvard.edu/ideas/usable-knowledge/19/10/tapping-power-intrinsic-motivation', 'https://www.edutopia.org/article/6-strategies-promoting-student-autonomy/', 'https://president.princeton.edu/blogs/beyond-university-rankings-promoting-transparency-and-accountability', 'https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/cm/', 'https://coloradosun.com/2024/03/19/charter-schools-education-opinion-zornio/', 'https://epaa.asu.edu/index.php/epaa/article/view/1315', 'https://malliotakis.house.gov/media/press-releases/malliotakis-university-accountability-act-passes-out-house-ways-means', 'https://www.teachhub.com/teaching-strategies/2021/06/how-to-increase-student-accountability/', 'https://improvingteaching.co.uk/2022/04/03/fixing-accountability-in-schools-less-accounting-more-account/', 'https://etico.iiep.unesco.org/en/10-ways-promote-transparency-and-accountability-education', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9047607/', 'https://www.nysed.gov/accountability/improvement-planning']",education

"Even though the technology is beneficial, there are also some disadvantages to the concept. Have a look below:
1. Potential of Over-Reliance
The overuse of immersive learning technologies might hinder the growth of other abilities, including communication, critical thinking, and problem-solving. Being immersed in a virtual world puts expressions, body language and some other human cues on hindsight, making interactions lesser effective. This questions the stability of these virtual learning environments.
2. Highly Skilled Workforce
All types of immersive learning technologies are worked on and handled by highly experienced and skilled professionals. Consequently, without the people involved, these technologies would not be as effective in aiding any learning experience.
3. Learning Outcomes
Relying on immersive learning environments could cause students to get preoccupied with the devices rather than the learning process, making the learning process suffer. Moreover, there is no actual evidence that using immersive learning technologies improve learning outcomes or the process.
4. Safety Concerns
A virtual environment could cause certain users to experience physical or psychological harm, like nausea, migraines, dizziness, or balance problems. Virtual reality headsets, 3D glasses, controllers, or earbuds could also make you prone to pathogens that can spread between users who use the same devices. Moreover, some users claim that they experience momentary fuzziness, lightheadedness, or dream-like states after being immersed in a virtual environment.
5. Limited Real-World Applicability
Immersive learning experiences don't always translate to practical situations. These settings can be helpful for practice and feedback. Still, they might need to accurately reflect the complexity of actual situations. This may reduce how well the training prepares students for real-world job settings.
Best Practices for Effective Learning
Effective Learning with Immersive Learning in education is possible with the following practices:
1. Define Learning Objectives
Establishing the learning objectives in detail is crucial before developing an immersive learning experience. This will make it easier to ensure that the training aligns with the targeted results and that learners know what is expected of them. It will not only help in achieving your goals faster but also helps in testing your progress. You can also make a note of the time taken and techniques followed to achieve the task and improve it for further projects.
2. Include Interactivity
Utilize different learning modalities such as lectures, podcasts, videos, or interactive activities to reinforce key concepts. Interactive, immersive training in education is also a part of these modalities to promote the involvement and engagement of learners. This could involve simulations and situations that let students use their knowledge in a real-world setting and get rapid feedback.
3. Make it Realistic
The most natural settings should be used for creating immersive learning experiences. This can involve including true-to-life situations, simulations, and environments to aid learners in acquiring the abilities and information required to succeed in practical settings.
Make sure that the type of immersive learning experience you are offering for educational purposes is accessible to all. All learners, including those with disabilities, should be able to participate in immersive learning experiences. This can involve making the platform compatible with assistive technology and offering different formats for students with visual or aural impairments.
5. Include Social Learning Aspects
To encourage student cooperation and knowledge sharing, immersive learning should include social learning opportunities. This may entail including forums, collaborative projects, and peer review exercises.
Immersive Learning vs Experiential Learning
Immersive learning is an educational approach that immerses students in a virtual or physical environment that simulates real-world scenarios. It is designed to help learners better understand and retain information by actively engaging them in learning. Examples of immersive learning include virtual reality, augmented reality, and simulation-based learning.
Experiential learning is an educational approach that emphasizes the hands-on exploration of concepts and skills. It allows learners to apply knowledge and skills in a practical setting and explore real-world problems. Examples of experimental learning include field trips, problem-based learning, and internships.

"Even though the technology is beneficial, there are also some disadvantages to the concept. Have a look below:
1. Potential of Over-Reliance
The overuse of immersive learning technologies might hinder the growth of other abilities, including communication, critical thinking, and problem-solving. Being immersed in a virtual world puts expressions, body language and some other human cues on hindsight, making interactions lesser effective. This questions the stability of these virtual learning environments.
2. Highly Skilled Workforce
All types of immersive learning technologies are worked on and handled by highly experienced and skilled professionals. Consequently, without the people involved, these technologies would not be as effective in aiding any learning experience.
3. Learning Outcomes
Relying on immersive learning environments could cause students to get preoccupied with the devices rather than the learning process, making the learning process suffer. Moreover, there is no actual evidence that using immersive learning technologies improve learning outcomes or the process.
4. Safety Concerns
A virtual environment could cause certain users to experience physical or psychological harm, like nausea, migraines, dizziness, or balance problems. Virtual reality headsets, 3D glasses, controllers, or earbuds could also make you prone to pathogens that can spread between users who use the same devices. Moreover, some users claim that they experience momentary fuzziness, lightheadedness, or dream-like states after being immersed in a virtual environment.
5. Limited Real-World Applicability
Immersive learning experiences don't always translate to practical situations. These settings can be helpful for practice and feedback. Still, they might need to accurately reflect the complexity of actual situations. This may reduce how well the training prepares students for real-world job settings.
Best Practices for Effective Learning
Effective Learning with Immersive Learning in education is possible with the following practices:
1. Define Learning Objectives
Establishing the learning objectives in detail is crucial before developing an immersive learning experience. This will make it easier to ensure that the training aligns with the targeted results and that learners know what is expected of them. It will not only help in achieving your goals faster but also helps in testing your progress. You can also make a note of the time taken and techniques followed to achieve the task and improve it for further projects.
2. Include Interactivity
Utilize different learning modalities such as lectures, podcasts, videos, or interactive activities to reinforce key concepts. Interactive, immersive training in education is also a part of these modalities to promote the involvement and engagement of learners. This could involve simulations and situations that let students use their knowledge in a real-world setting and get rapid feedback.
3. Make it Realistic
The most natural settings should be used for creating immersive learning experiences. This can involve including true-to-life situations, simulations, and environments to aid learners in acquiring the abilities and information required to succeed in practical settings.
Make sure that the type of immersive learning experience you are offering for educational purposes is accessible to all. All learners, including those with disabilities, should be able to participate in immersive learning experiences. This can involve making the platform compatible with assistive technology and offering different formats for students with visual or aural impairments.
5. Include Social Learning Aspects
To encourage student cooperation and knowledge sharing, immersive learning should include social learning opportunities. This may entail including forums, collaborative projects, and peer review exercises.
Immersive Learning vs Experiential Learning
Immersive learning is an educational approach that immerses students in a virtual or physical environment that simulates real-world scenarios. It is designed to help learners better understand and retain information by actively engaging them in learning. Examples of immersive learning include virtual reality, augmented reality, and simulation-based learning.
Experiential learning is an educational approach that emphasizes the hands-on exploration of concepts and skills. It allows learners to apply knowledge and skills in a practical setting and explore real-world problems. Examples of experimental learning include field trips, problem-based learning, and internships.
Immersive learning primarily aims to provide learners with a realistic setting that simulates. real-world events. The goal is to assist learners in acquiring knowledge and skills in a secure and controlled environment, free of the risks associated with real-world circumstances.","How can educators ensure that immersive learning experiences align with the learning objectives and outcomes, and what strategies can they use to assess the effectiveness of these experiences in promoting deep learning and retention of knowledge?","To ensure that immersive learning experiences align with learning objectives and outcomes, educators can employ various strategies and considerations.","['https://christianscholars.com/how-immersive-experiences-can-help-faculty-and-students-grow/', 'https://itif.org/publications/2021/08/30/promise-immersive-learning-augmented-and-virtual-reality-potential/', 'https://www.tuck.dartmouth.edu/mba/blog/discovering-tucks-immersive-learning-experiences', 'https://elearningindustry.com/how-to-create-immersive-learning-experiences-for-your-learners', 'https://edtechbooks.org/designing_immersive_Learning_experience', 'https://altc.alt.ac.uk/blog/2023/12/10-top-tips-for-including-immersive-learning-into-your-classroom/', 'https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/12/13/2832', 'https://www.centerforengagedlearning.org/resources/immersive-learning/', 'https://vr.nmsuondemand.nmsu.edu/courses/designing-the-future-instructional-design-in-the-metaverse', 'https://www.magicedtech.com/build/immersive-learning-solutions/', 'https://www.cambridgeenglish.org/blog/the-benefit-of-immersive-language-learning-experiences-and-how-to-create-them/', 'https://www.futurevisual.com/blog/immersive-learning/', 'https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/rise-immersive-learning-samson-tan-dr-', 'https://elearningindustry.com/how-to-create-immersive-learning-experiences-for-your-learners', 'https://www.td.org/talent-development-leader/the-rise-of-immersive-learning', 'https://medium.com/@matthew.schmidt_10201/whats-the-difference-between-learning-experience-design-and-instructional-design-915eb600b5f', 'https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10648-020-09586-2', 'https://altc.alt.ac.uk/blog/2023/12/10-top-tips-for-including-immersive-learning-into-your-classroom/', 'https://christianscholars.com/how-immersive-experiences-can-help-faculty-and-students-grow/', 'https://www.tuck.dartmouth.edu/mba/blog/discovering-tucks-immersive-learning-experiences']",education
"- Fourth, create personal relevance. All students have individual interests: those things they come into your classroom caring about. They also have situational interests: the things they’re motivated to care about because of the enthusiasm and passion of their teachers and peers. Both these areas are rich sources of goals that help students understand the meaning behind their learning.
- Goal Setting in Action: Whether a student is interested in frogs, robotics, or videos and animation, finding ways to allow students to bring those interests with them into the classroom helps them connect with what they’re learning. The reading teacher who helped a student engage with his interest in frogs while learning valuable reading skills was creating personal relevance.
- Fifth, use student choice. While not all students will be ready to set their own goals today, the ultimate objective is that all students take control of what and how they learn. To get them there, provide students meaningful choices over the activities they engage in, the academic areas they focus on, or the ways they show mastery in a subject. With their personal goal in hand, a student can focus on their individual learning and over time build the ownership they need to continue learning over the course of their lifetime.
- Goal Setting in Action: Some examples of supporting student choice are active listening, allowing independent time for goal setting and reflection, and reminding students of the hard work and progress they’ve already achieved. Encouraging students to be part of creating their own goals and reflecting on those goals more deeply connects students to those goals.
In many ways, technology is the “force multiplier” that can make this all possible. A classroom with one or two educators can’t reasonably expect an adult to guide five to 10 different activities at once, all reaching students from where they are. Providing meaningful activities where students can self-direct their learning allows them to practice key knowledge, apply knowledge in new situations, and work with standards at greater complexity while freeing teachers to focus on students who most need direct intervention.
Starting with Small Steps
A school culture where all members are focused on helping students achieve meaningful and ambitious goals — what some researchers call “academic press” (Leithwood and Sun, 2018) — won’t emerge overnight. While changing a culture seems complicated, it really is nothing more than the sum of a thousand small actions that communicate a common message to students, teachers, and leaders.
Even if your classroom or school can’t take on a full goal-setting practice today, little changes like providing students with opportunities to break down academic standards into their own words, or to discuss their areas of focus for an academic year, can begin to plant a culture focused on student growth.
Workshops never begin with all their tools in exactly the right place. As you progress from beginner to expert in any craft, you find the tools and workstations that meet your needs, and the most effective workshop begins to take shape.
The workshop classroom will also emerge over time. As you go to find your tools, consider what your group of young makers is ready for, where their skills lie, and what they ultimately want to build. Combining these tools with the techniques that direct them toward the right ends will help make sure learning in your workshop creates growth, builds motivation, and reinforces student agency.

"- Fourth, create personal relevance. All students have individual interests: those things they come into your classroom caring about. They also have situational interests: the things they’re motivated to care about because of the enthusiasm and passion of their teachers and peers. Both these areas are rich sources of goals that help students understand the meaning behind their learning.
- Goal Setting in Action: Whether a student is interested in frogs, robotics, or videos and animation, finding ways to allow students to bring those interests with them into the classroom helps them connect with what they’re learning. The reading teacher who helped a student engage with his interest in frogs while learning valuable reading skills was creating personal relevance.
- Fifth, use student choice. While not all students will be ready to set their own goals today, the ultimate objective is that all students take control of what and how they learn. To get them there, provide students meaningful choices over the activities they engage in, the academic areas they focus on, or the ways they show mastery in a subject. With their personal goal in hand, a student can focus on their individual learning and over time build the ownership they need to continue learning over the course of their lifetime.
- Goal Setting in Action: Some examples of supporting student choice are active listening, allowing independent time for goal setting and reflection, and reminding students of the hard work and progress they’ve already achieved. Encouraging students to be part of creating their own goals and reflecting on those goals more deeply connects students to those goals.
In many ways, technology is the “force multiplier” that can make this all possible. A classroom with one or two educators can’t reasonably expect an adult to guide five to 10 different activities at once, all reaching students from where they are. Providing meaningful activities where students can self-direct their learning allows them to practice key knowledge, apply knowledge in new situations, and work with standards at greater complexity while freeing teachers to focus on students who most need direct intervention.
Starting with Small Steps
A school culture where all members are focused on helping students achieve meaningful and ambitious goals — what some researchers call “academic press” (Leithwood and Sun, 2018) — won’t emerge overnight. While changing a culture seems complicated, it really is nothing more than the sum of a thousand small actions that communicate a common message to students, teachers, and leaders.
Even if your classroom or school can’t take on a full goal-setting practice today, little changes like providing students with opportunities to break down academic standards into their own words, or to discuss their areas of focus for an academic year, can begin to plant a culture focused on student growth.
Workshops never begin with all their tools in exactly the right place. As you progress from beginner to expert in any craft, you find the tools and workstations that meet your needs, and the most effective workshop begins to take shape.
The workshop classroom will also emerge over time. As you go to find your tools, consider what your group of young makers is ready for, where their skills lie, and what they ultimately want to build. Combining these tools with the techniques that direct them toward the right ends will help make sure learning in your workshop creates growth, builds motivation, and reinforces student agency.

Denver, CO: Marzano Research Laboratory, 2009.",How can a teacher design a lesson plan that encourages students to take ownership of their learning while still meeting the needs of students who may struggle with independence?,"To design a lesson plan that encourages students to take ownership of their learning while meeting the needs of students who may struggle with independence, a teacher should consider the following strategies:

1. Encourage student reflection on their learning experiences, asking questions about what worked well and what didn't.
2. Create a classroom culture that promotes shared ownership and autonomy, such as having students conduct lectures or create open-ended assignments.
3. Provide opportunities for students to interact with each other and with the teacher, such as through group work or one-on-one conferences.
4. Offer choices and allow students to take ownership of their learning by making decisions about what they want to learn and how they want to learn it.
5. Provide scaffolding and support for students who may struggle with independence, such as through the use of assistive technology or one-on-one instruction.
6. Encourage students to set goals and track their progress, providing feedback and encouragement along the way.
7. Teach students how to best structure their independent learning time, such as through the use of planners or calendars.
8. Provide opportunities for students to engage in self-monitoring and self-assessment, such as through the use of rubrics or self-evaluation forms.
9. Encourage students to use a planner or calendar to stay organized and on track.
10. Provide opportunities for students to engage in reflection and self-reflection, such as through the use of journaling or self-reflection prompts.

By incorporating these strategies into a lesson plan, teachers can encourage students to take ownership of their learning while also providing support and scaffolding for students who may struggle with independence.","['https://www.puzzleshiftcreate.com/teacher-resources/student-ownership-of-learning/', 'https://www.edutopia.org/article/creating-classroom-culture-shared-ownership/', 'https://www.teachhub.com/classroom-management/2021/06/tools-to-promote-student-ownership-of-learning/', 'https://nearpod.com/blog/4-ways-to-let-kids-take-ownership-of-their-learning/', 'https://collegereadiness.uworld.com/blog/10-ways-to-increase-intrinsic-motivation-in-students-to-drive-learning/', 'https://ellstudents.com/blogs/the-confianza-way/building-student-ownership-and-engagement-for-language-learners', 'https://www.niet.org/assets/Resources/student-ownership-thinking-problem-solving.pdf', 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15326985ep3902_2', 'https://blog.wakelet.com/empowering-students-the-key-to-student-ownership-of-learning', 'https://www.niet.org/assets/Resources/student-engagement-versus-student-ownership.pdf', 'https://www.edutopia.org/article/guiding-students-be-independent-learners/', 'https://www.invictus.edu.kh/news/9-proven-methods-that-cultivate-independence-in-students', 'https://www.oakmeadow.com/12-ways-to-support-student-independence-and-autonomy-in-learning/', 'https://blog.irisconnect.com/uk/blog/9-tips-for-encouraging-students-to-become-independent-learners/', 'https://www.teachthought.com/pedagogy/help-students-independent/', 'https://exceptionalchildren.org/blog/how-i-encourage-independence-classroom', 'https://www.readingrockets.org/topics/social-emotional-learning/articles/9-ways-teach-social-skills-your-classroom', 'https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/opinion-ways-to-implement-restorative-practices-in-the-classroom/2020/01', 'https://www.readingrockets.org/topics/learning-disabilities/articles/assistive-technology-kids-learning-disabilities-overview', 'https://emmatheteachie.com/5-ways-to-turn-your-students-into-independent-learners/', 'https://www.puzzleshiftcreate.com/teacher-resources/student-ownership-of-learning/', 'https://www.edutopia.org/article/creating-classroom-culture-shared-ownership/', 'https://www.teachhub.com/classroom-management/2021/06/tools-to-promote-student-ownership-of-learning/', 'https://nearpod.com/blog/4-ways-to-let-kids-take-ownership-of-their-learning/', 'https://collegereadiness.uworld.com/blog/10-ways-to-increase-intrinsic-motivation-in-students-to-drive-learning/', 'https://ellstudents.com/blogs/the-confianza-way/building-student-ownership-and-engagement-for-language-learners', 'https://www.niet.org/assets/Resources/student-ownership-thinking-problem-solving.pdf', 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15326985ep3902_2', 'https://blog.wakelet.com/empowering-students-the-key-to-student-ownership-of-learning', 'https://www.niet.org/assets/Resources/student-engagement-versus-student-ownership.pdf']",education
"Since a recent NAEP study has shown a tight correlation between vocabulary and reading comprehension, some of the challenges facing the U.S. today are to greatly reduce the number of families living in poverty, educate all parents and daycare caregivers about the importance of talking to children in meaningful ways from birth on, and bring equity to under-resourced schools.
Poverty and achievement
It’s difficult to comprehend that the U.S., the wealthiest nation in the world, cannot significantly reduce the amount of poverty and raise the achievement levels of all children. Or that federal and state departments of education have failed to factor into their reform policies the significance of our high poverty rate, the lack of equity in education, and the relationship of poverty and inequity to children’s ability to learn and achieve.
Most of the lowest achieving schools in the U.S. have the highest number of disadvantaged students and are under-resourced. Yet, the thinking that is shaping education policy today seems to be that greater accountability, more “rigorous” curriculum standards, and tougher tests are sufficient to produce better teaching, higher test scores and “success for all.” Nowhere is the issue of poverty even acknowledged in current government initiatives.
Certainly the educators who work in state and federal education departments know better – many of them have worked in such communities and schools. But too often, a code of silence prevails in the face of misguided political decisions.
With the professed belief among policy makers and advisors that stricter accountability for teachers and administrators can reverse our downward reading-score trend, a national culture of blame and finger pointing has arisen. States have adopted regressive policies that tie teachers’ and administrators’ evaluations to students’ test scores, possibly affecting job security and punishing schools in high poverty communities by labeling them as “failing.”
Such accountability ignores the fact that every student can make progress, but not every student can meet the one-size-progress-for-all goal set by state departments of education. In this punitive and negative climate, it can become increasingly difficult to find teachers willing to work with English language learners, special education students, and high-poverty populations who can, and do, improve but often don’t meet mandated progress levels.
We admonish teachers to not teach to the test. Yet their evaluations of job performance depend on the annual test scores. So, of course teachers will teach to the tests, even though doing so adversely affects all children’s education by diminishing creative, innovative, and critical thinking.
Suppressing creative and critical thinking
At the College of William and Mary in Virginia, Dr. Kyung Hee Kim, an educational psychologist, started a study of creativity test results in 1990 and published her findings in 2011. Dr. Kim revealed a significant decrease in the creativity scores of children in kindergarten through grade six in the United States.
As Dr. Kim described in the 2012 Torrance Lecture at the University of Georgia College of Education, creativity scores, which had been on the rise prior to 1990 and prior to the No Child Left Behind and Reading First initiatives, have been steadily falling for the past two decades.
Dr. Kim’s study also showed that the relationship between IQ and creativity is small. According to Dr. Kim, creativity requires a climate and attitude where teachers and parents support students to play, explore new ideas, and experience a combination of convergent and divergent thinking.
Creative children can generate a wide range of ideas to solve problems. In particular, divergent thinking is the aspect of creativity that future generations will need to solve problems of war and genocide and fast-spreading diseases like Ebola.
The play and exploration in active learning environments that education philosopher and psychologist John Dewey described more than a century ago mirror the ways that children learn and develop creative, divergent thinking. It’s by doing, by pretending and role-playing, by listening to dozens of books read each day and discussing and dramatizing them, by engaging in meaningful conversations, by collaborative and generative problem solving, painting, dancing, and music, that children develop creativity.
With the onset of state and Common Core tests, our nation has adopted teaching practices that deter creative thinking and innovation. In an effort to improve reading scores, play as a way of exploring and learning has been greatly reduced in preschool. Instead, three- and four-year-olds spend their time learning the alphabet, studying letter-sound relationships and sight words, and developing phonemic awareness skills – in lieu of engaging in play as a way to understand concepts, group and classify items, and problem-solve.","How can a school district in a low-income area leverage their cultural heritage to improve student engagement and motivation, while also addressing the achievement gap in reading comprehension?","To leverage cultural heritage and improve student engagement and motivation, a school district in a low-income area can consider incorporating culturally responsive practices and culturally relevant materials into their curriculum.

One approach is to establish community-based programs that provide resources and support for families, such as Head Start programs, which promote school readiness for young children from low-income families. Additionally, promoting a culture of meaningful conversations with children can be achieved through various strategies, including:

1. Encouraging open and honest communication: This can be done by creating a safe and non-judgmental environment where children feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and feelings.
2. Active listening: Parents and caregivers should actively listen to children, paying attention to their words and emotions, and responding in a way that shows they care.
3. Asking open-ended questions: Asking open-ended questions can help stimulate meaningful conversations and encourage children to think critically and share their thoughts and feelings.
4. Sharing personal experiences: Sharing personal experiences and stories can help children feel more connected to their parents and caregivers, and can provide opportunities for meaningful conversations.
5. Encouraging children to express themselves: Encouraging children to express themselves through art, music, or other forms of self-expression can provide opportunities for meaningful conversations and help children develop their communication skills.

By implementing these strategies, parents and caregivers can foster a sense of community among low-income families and promote a culture of meaningful conversations with children. This can have a positive impact on children's social and emotional development, and can help them develop the skills they need to succeed in school and beyond.

In terms of how this approach can potentially contribute to improved reading comprehension and vocabulary development in young children, research has shown that children who engage in meaningful conversations with their parents and caregivers tend to have better language skills and a stronger foundation for reading and literacy. Additionally, children who are exposed to a rich and varied vocabulary through conversations with their parents and caregivers tend to have a larger vocabulary and better reading comprehension skills. By promoting a culture of meaningful conversations with children, parents and caregivers can help support their language and literacy development, and set them up for success in school and beyond.","['https://www.all4kids.org/news/blog/poverty-and-its-effects-on-children/', 'https://www.childwelfare.gov/topics/prevention/', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9292156/', 'https://safesupportivelearning.ed.gov/training-technical-assistance/education-level/early-learning/family-school-community-partnerships', 'https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/surgeon-general-social-connection-advisory.pdf', 'https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ohs/about/head-start', 'https://lao.ca.gov/Publications/Report/4897', 'https://nij.ojp.gov/topics/articles/hidden-consequences-impact-incarceration-dependent-children', 'https://www.casey.org/economic-supports/', 'https://health.gov/healthypeople/priority-areas/social-determinants-health/literature-summaries/early-childhood-development-and-education', 'https://www.ncdhhs.gov/divisions/social-services/child-welfare-services/community-based-programs', 'https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ocs/programs', 'https://chfs.ky.gov/services/Pages/search.aspx', 'https://www.csd.ca.gov/Pages/Assistance-CommunityServices.aspx', 'https://www.pima.gov/887/Community-Assistance-Division', 'https://www.pa.gov/en/agencies/dhs/resources/home-community-based-services-hcbs.html', 'https://www.mdhs.ms.gov/community/', 'https://aging.ca.gov/Programs_and_Services/', 'https://www.cssny.org/programs', 'https://www.dds.ca.gov/initiatives/hcbs/', 'https://elisabethbostwick.com/2020/07/23/harnessing-the-power-of-meaningful-student-conversation/', 'https://mccormickcenter.nl.edu/library/cultural-competence-conversations-121223/', 'https://emptynestblessed.com/2022/09/28/meaningful-conversations-adult-kids/', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/19/opinion/social-skills-connection.html', 'https://www.focusonthefamily.com/parenting/get-your-kids-to-talk-to-you/', 'https://www.pbs.org/parents/talking-about-racism', 'https://www.impactboom.org/blog/2023/01/22/jenae-tien-on-helping-educators-and-parents-spark-conversations-around-diversity', 'https://gospelproject.lifeway.com/8-tips-to-help-you-disciple-your-kids/', 'https://coxcampus.org/5-meaningful-ways-to-support-dual-language-learners-at-storytime/', 'http://millerbrian.com/stories-n-stuff/2022/1/10/igmq9sxtyu992614fopl360ocphnnf']",education

It’s by doing, by pretending and role-playing, by listening to dozens of books read each day and discussing and dramatizing them, by engaging in meaningful conversations, by collaborative and generative problem solving, painting, dancing, and music, that children develop creativity.
With the onset of state and Common Core tests, our nation has adopted teaching practices that deter creative thinking and innovation. In an effort to improve reading scores, play as a way of exploring and learning has been greatly reduced in preschool. Instead, three- and four-year-olds spend their time learning the alphabet, studying letter-sound relationships and sight words, and developing phonemic awareness skills – in lieu of engaging in play as a way to understand concepts, group and classify items, and problem-solve.",How might a state education department's decision to reduce funding for arts programs in local schools impact the overall quality of education and student creativity in those schools?,"The reduction in funding for arts programs in local schools can have a significant impact on the overall quality of education and student creativity.

"Since a recent NAEP study has shown a tight correlation between vocabulary and reading comprehension, some of the challenges facing the U.S. today are to greatly reduce the number of families living in poverty, educate all parents and daycare caregivers about the importance of talking to children in meaningful ways from birth on, and bring equity to under-resourced schools.
Poverty and achievement
It’s difficult to comprehend that the U.S., the wealthiest nation in the world, cannot significantly reduce the amount of poverty and raise the achievement levels of all children. Or that federal and state departments of education have failed to factor into their reform policies the significance of our high poverty rate, the lack of equity in education, and the relationship of poverty and inequity to children’s ability to learn and achieve.
Most of the lowest achieving schools in the U.S. have the highest number of disadvantaged students and are under-resourced. Yet, the thinking that is shaping education policy today seems to be that greater accountability, more “rigorous” curriculum standards, and tougher tests are sufficient to produce better teaching, higher test scores and “success for all.” Nowhere is the issue of poverty even acknowledged in current government initiatives.
Certainly the educators who work in state and federal education departments know better – many of them have worked in such communities and schools. But too often, a code of silence prevails in the face of misguided political decisions.
With the professed belief among policy makers and advisors that stricter accountability for teachers and administrators can reverse our downward reading-score trend, a national culture of blame and finger pointing has arisen. States have adopted regressive policies that tie teachers’ and administrators’ evaluations to students’ test scores, possibly affecting job security and punishing schools in high poverty communities by labeling them as “failing.”
Such accountability ignores the fact that every student can make progress, but not every student can meet the one-size-progress-for-all goal set by state departments of education. In this punitive and negative climate, it can become increasingly difficult to find teachers willing to work with English language learners, special education students, and high-poverty populations who can, and do, improve but often don’t meet mandated progress levels.
We admonish teachers to not teach to the test. Yet their evaluations of job performance depend on the annual test scores. So, of course teachers will teach to the tests, even though doing so adversely affects all children’s education by diminishing creative, innovative, and critical thinking.
Suppressing creative and critical thinking
At the College of William and Mary in Virginia, Dr. Kyung Hee Kim, an educational psychologist, started a study of creativity test results in 1990 and published her findings in 2011. Dr. Kim revealed a significant decrease in the creativity scores of children in kindergarten through grade six in the United States.
As Dr. Kim described in the 2012 Torrance Lecture at the University of Georgia College of Education, creativity scores, which had been on the rise prior to 1990 and prior to the No Child Left Behind and Reading First initiatives, have been steadily falling for the past two decades.
Dr. Kim’s study also showed that the relationship between IQ and creativity is small. According to Dr. Kim, creativity requires a climate and attitude where teachers and parents support students to play, explore new ideas, and experience a combination of convergent and divergent thinking.
Creative children can generate a wide range of ideas to solve problems. In particular, divergent thinking is the aspect of creativity that future generations will need to solve problems of war and genocide and fast-spreading diseases like Ebola.
