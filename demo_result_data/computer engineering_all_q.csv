"A computer has been one of mankind’s greatest invention among other inventions ever since the foundation of science began. Its development was a result of years and years of long experiments spanning a hundred or so years conducted not just by one man, but many. Development of computers as it is today is a continuous process and it will ever be. Computers, however simple they may seem now to the computer literate, has a complex set of system underneath. It takes multiple disciplines in both computer studies and electronics to fully understand them. After all, computer in itself is subdivided into branches as is science itself.
While other technological inventions may have had already been developed prior to the foundation of science, “technology” is not yet a proper term for such. The word technology, after all, is always correlated with science and both science and technology are mutually inclusive to one another, strictly speaking in terminologies. Computers of today, however advanced they may seem, have had its origins in humble beginnings.
How did computer began?
Abacus, the earliest form of calculator, has been recorded to be in use since the early civilizations estimated to be around 1000 and 500 B.C., only to be adopted elsewhere in the world. The idea on how the algorithm of a computer does its arithmetic was based on this, in logic. Soon after, for as early as 1820’s, in the personification of Charles Babbage, dubbed to be one of the fathers of modern computer, developed ideas on how computers should do its math, initially known as the difference engine, it developed later after to become what is known as the analytical engine. While Charles Babbage, due to funding issues, didn’t get to see his ideas into fruition during his lifetime, it is his youngest son, Henry Babbage, who did so in 1910 based on his. However, this primitive form of computer is not as advanced as how we see on computers of today.
The idea of the need to do the computation on our behalf as man, hence the word ‘computer,’ came out of the need to handle complex problems and perform complex computations that is both difficult and takes longer time for man to handle. Especially true during the times of the industrialization era and great world war where the need for such arose. How a computer behaves is what’s in a library of a computer.
The development of computer grew by a lot since laying the foundation by Charles Babbage as was inspired by existing “technologies” of its time. From names of people of the past significant in the foundation of computers such as Ada Lovelace, Konrad Zuse, Alan Turing, John Atanasoff & Clifford Berry, Howard Aiken & Grace Hopper, so on and so forth, up to the present computer giant names such as William Gates, Steve Wozniak, and Steve Jobs, among others, computers of today are bigger in functions than they are their sizes and have found a spot in every people’s lives in both commercial and personal usage.
How do people use computers in their daily lives?
Modern day computers laid out the foundation on how we perform duties of today. It is a lot more efficient and makes the work done in shorter times. From a simple household leisure such is playing games or running multimedia programs, to doing office works, to a more difficult developing programs, up to a more complex computations such is done in NASA, computers made all this possible — all in a single box. What once takes a long time to finish in groups as in seen in companies without computers, can now be finished in shorter times with those.
Computers taking over the world
Also one of the most popular usage of computers is the internet. What once was the trend for telephones and telegrams, has become internet’s – and it is worldwide. Literally, computers taking over the world.
Although initially used for military purposes concurrent to the development of the computer, the internet grew up to become commercialized as it is used today. The internet, in conjunction to and other than the previous means, made communication around the world possible which also gave rise to communication tools such as the social media. To date, billions of people use computers with the internet every day.

Its development was a result of years and years of long experiments spanning a hundred or so years conducted not just by one man, but many. Development of computers as it is today is a continuous process and it will ever be. Computers, however simple they may seem now to the computer literate, has a complex set of system underneath. It takes multiple disciplines in both computer studies and electronics to fully understand them. After all, computer in itself is subdivided into branches as is science itself.
While other technological inventions may have had already been developed prior to the foundation of science, “technology” is not yet a proper term for such. The word technology, after all, is always correlated with science and both science and technology are mutually inclusive to one another, strictly speaking in terminologies. Computers of today, however advanced they may seem, have had its origins in humble beginnings.
How did computer began?
Abacus, the earliest form of calculator, has been recorded to be in use since the early civilizations estimated to be around 1000 and 500 B.C., only to be adopted elsewhere in the world. The idea on how the algorithm of a computer does its arithmetic was based on this, in logic. Soon after, for as early as 1820’s, in the personification of Charles Babbage, dubbed to be one of the fathers of modern computer, developed ideas on how computers should do its math, initially known as the difference engine, it developed later after to become what is known as the analytical engine. While Charles Babbage, due to funding issues, didn’t get to see his ideas into fruition during his lifetime, it is his youngest son, Henry Babbage, who did so in 1910 based on his. However, this primitive form of computer is not as advanced as how we see on computers of today.
The idea of the need to do the computation on our behalf as man, hence the word ‘computer,’ came out of the need to handle complex problems and perform complex computations that is both difficult and takes longer time for man to handle. Especially true during the times of the industrialization era and great world war where the need for such arose. How a computer behaves is what’s in a library of a computer.
The development of computer grew by a lot since laying the foundation by Charles Babbage as was inspired by existing “technologies” of its time. From names of people of the past significant in the foundation of computers such as Ada Lovelace, Konrad Zuse, Alan Turing, John Atanasoff & Clifford Berry, Howard Aiken & Grace Hopper, so on and so forth, up to the present computer giant names such as William Gates, Steve Wozniak, and Steve Jobs, among others, computers of today are bigger in functions than they are their sizes and have found a spot in every people’s lives in both commercial and personal usage.
How do people use computers in their daily lives?
Modern day computers laid out the foundation on how we perform duties of today. It is a lot more efficient and makes the work done in shorter times. From a simple household leisure such is playing games or running multimedia programs, to doing office works, to a more difficult developing programs, up to a more complex computations such is done in NASA, computers made all this possible — all in a single box. What once takes a long time to finish in groups as in seen in companies without computers, can now be finished in shorter times with those.
Computers taking over the world
Also one of the most popular usage of computers is the internet. What once was the trend for telephones and telegrams, has become internet’s – and it is worldwide. Literally, computers taking over the world.
Although initially used for military purposes concurrent to the development of the computer, the internet grew up to become commercialized as it is used today. The internet, in conjunction to and other than the previous means, made communication around the world possible which also gave rise to communication tools such as the social media. To date, billions of people use computers with the internet every day.

"In this blog article, we’ll set out on a trip to comprehend the essence of technology in computer programming.
As we study, programming technology will develop. We shall trace the primary programming productivity turning moments from low-level to high-level languages. Version control systems and integrated development environments (IDEs) have revolutionized programmers’ workflows.
Defining Technology in Computer Programming
Computer programming technology refers to tools, software, and hardware that help design, build, and manage software programs. Programmers employ several components to write, test, debug, and deploy code.
Computer programming lets people turn logical instructions into executable programs for computers and other devices. It enables programmers to maximize computer processing power to meet consumer needs and solve complex problems.
Computer programming technology may be categorized as follows:
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are powerful software packages that speed development. Code editors, debuggers, compilers, and build automation tools are commonly included. Visual Studio, Eclipse, and the JetBrains toolkit offer a single environment for writing, testing, and delivering code, making programmers more productive.
Frameworks and Libraries: Frameworks and libraries speed development by providing reusable pieces and abstractions. Instead of reinventing the wheel, programmers may focus on application logic with their fixed structures and functionalities. React, Angular, Django, and TensorFlow.
VCS helps programmers manage source code repositories, track changes, and communicate. Branching, merging, and conflict resolution help developers collaborate on a project. Git, Mercurial, and Subversion dominate version control.
Technology offers several tools for testing and debugging code to verify its reliability. Programmers use debuggers, code analyzers, and unit testing frameworks to detect and repair app bugs. JUnit, PyTest, and Visual Studio Debugger.
Infrastructure and Deployment Tools: Technology simplifies software management and deployment in many scenarios. Containerization platforms (Docker, Kubernetes), cloud computing services (Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure), and server configuration management tools (Ansible, Puppet) make application deployment and maintenance scalable, flexible, and effective.
The Evolution of Technology in Computer Programming
Programming technology has had a remarkable history characterized by game-changing discoveries and paradigm changes. The progress of technology has fundamentally changed how we create software, from the early days of programming languages to the modern era with complex tools and frameworks. Let’s examine the significant turning points that have influenced the development of programming technology:
Machine language and low-level languages:
In the early days of computing, programmers typed instructions directly in machine code, made up of binary numbers that computers could interpret. Assembly languages appeared as computers grew more powerful, offering a more legible representation of machine code. Fine-grained control over hardware resources was possible because of these low-level languages.
Advanced Languages -(Technology in Computer Programming):
High-level languages like Fortran, COBOL, and Lisp were introduced, representing a considerable programming technology advancement. Because these languages enable programmers to describe sophisticated reasoning using human-friendly syntax, productivity has grown, and greater abstraction has been added. Higher levels of modularity and code reuse were made possible by high-level languages.
Development environments that are integrated:
The introduction of IDEs altered the programming environment. IDEs like Turbo Pascal, Borland C++, and Microsoft Visual Studio brought code editors, compilers, debuggers, and other tools into a single integrated environment. IDEs introduced capabilities like auto-completion, code refactoring, and project management while streamlining the development process and increasing productivity.
OOP: Object-Oriented Programming
In the 1980s, OOP became a potent paradigm for programming thanks to tools like C++ and Smalltalk. Classes, objects, and inheritance were introduced by OOP, enabling modular and reusable programming. This paradigm encouraged encapsulation, polymorphism, and code structure, tremendously aiding software development.
Libraries and Frameworks:
The growth of frameworks and libraries accelerated programming technology even more. The availability of ready-to-use structures, libraries, and standards in frameworks like Ruby on Rails, Django, and ASP.NET MVC sped up web application development. Client-side interaction and user interface creation were made more straightforward by libraries like jQuery, React, and Angular.

It’s easy to get attached to the idea of learning to code and program. When you start small and apply your knowledge and skill set, you can achieve great things. There is no one-size-fits solution to all of your programming related questions, which is why you have to start small.
The best thing you can do for yourself is to choose a topic that you are comfortable with and that you are interested in. Once you’ve chosen your course of study, make a list of all the things you want to learn. Now, it’s up to you to decide which topics will be a good fit, and which will be a waste of time and money.
Conclusion: Is Online Engineering Right for You?
Online engineering degrees provide a foundation for a career in a new industry. They also provide a sound educational foundation upon which you build. Many people choose to learn to code so they can work in a scripting or computer programming field.
However, the idea of becoming a programmer should be applied to almost all fields of science, technology, and business. It’s important to remember that there’s no one-size-fits-all solution to all of your programming-related questions. And, as a final thought, remember that you can never fully understand the capabilities of other technologies until you’ve worked with them in person or written code for them.
So, don’t get caught up in the details of choosing a college major or a networking event for your next club meeting. The important thing is to pick the right topic and be committed to its pursuit.","What are some potential drawbacks to relying solely on automated data processing in a business setting, and how can a programmer balance automation with human oversight to ensure optimal decision-making?"

"On the world stage, the International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR) sponsors both conferences and seminars it calls Cryptology Schools: four-to-five-day affairs that provide intense training in specific aspects of cybersecurity. Explained IACR chair Michel Abdalla, ""The main goal of IACR schools is to develop awareness and increased capacity for research in cryptology. In particular, IACR schools aim to fill gaps that may exist in local expertise."" Abdalla said the IACR schools address many topics in cybersecurity, ""and these evolve constantly based on the needs of real-world applications. Some examples of problems that have received a lot of attention recently include post-quantum security, side-channel [Spectre] resistance, cloud security, methods for computing with encrypted data, and privacy-preserving machine learning.""
According to Aysu, however, special programs are only stop-gap measures. If society is to successfully fill the gaping need for cybersecurity experts, then engineering curriculums need to incorporate training in cybersecurity from the outset. ""The majority of cyber-vulnerabilities occur due to the ignorance of well-meaning engineers/developers and can thus be fixed by proper education at the undergraduate and graduate level,"" he said.
One of the most immediate needs is for engineers who can design cryptographic hardware accelerators that will keep data secure in the coming era of quantum computers. Unfortunately, the most popular encryption methodologies today are based on variations of the ""large prime-number factors"" methodology. For instance, RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is one of the most widely used public-key crypto-systems. Unfortunately, it is based on the difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers. Quantum computers will eliminate this difficulty, exposing the entire history of encrypted state secrets, financial data, passwords, and anything else using RSA today.
Many alternatives to RSA are being researched and proposed today, but without proprietary hardware accelerators, none of them can assure enduring security against quantum computers, according to Aysu.
Some digital-computer algorithms have successfully implemented quantum computing techniques without waiting for actual quantum computers. For instance, Ewin Tang, an undergraduate at the University of Texas, set out to prove that quantum algorithms were faster than classical algorithms, but ""realized this was not the case."" Instead, she created a classical algorithm that was previously only believed to be possible with quantum computers. Her example algorithm was for predictive recommendations rather than cryptography, but her finding nevertheless proves that digital computers can execute clever algorithms that may equal or surpass future quantum algorithms.
""Cryptography has both theoretical and practical aspects,"" said Aysu. ""Cryptographic engineering focuses on those practical issues. Post-quantum cryptography is a broader field focusing on cryptographic solutions that can remain secure against future quantum computers, in both the theoretical and practical aspects.""
In order to reach a wider audience, Aysu is working on an online version of his course, potentially for release as early as 2020. The biggest hurdle to overcome, so far, is the lack of a textbook. Since the advent of malware like Meltdown and Spectre, many engineers have become aware of the need for a firm hardware foundation for cryptographic algorithms, but none have stepped forward to write a textbook about it, he said.

"Universities are pioneering new engineering techniques to defeat hackers using hardware cryptography. Instead of merely issuing an endless number of software updates to plug newly found vulnerabilities, engineers are being trained in how to design hardware accelerators engineered to be immune to software hacks. By training engineers to prevent software attacks by designing hacker-resistant cryptographic hardware, not only can today's data can be secured, but engineers can future-proof data for the coming quantum era, according to Aydin Aysu, an assistant professor in the department of electrical and computer engineering at North Carolina State University (NCSU).
""I definitely see cybersecurity majors becoming commonplace—in fact, they already are catching on in universities like Penn State Berks,"" said Aysu. At NCSU, Aysu is pioneering a course for graduate students with little or no experience in cryptography that teaches them how to design specialized hardware accelerators that are hacker-resistant. ""Such courses should cover not only the various technical disciplines in hardware, firmware, software, machine learning, and system design, but also focus on related societal aspects of cybersecurity, such as policy making.""
Aysu's course—Teaching the Next Generation of Cryptographic Hardware Design to the Next Generation of Engineers—features lab sessions in which students are shown how to prevent even the most sophisticated software attacks with hardware countermeasures. The course specifically teaches how to design application-specific hardware accelerators that sidestep the vulnerabilities in general-purpose processors. The worst of these—microprocessor vulnerabilities (Meltdown) and so-called side-channel attacks (Spectre)—can only be prevented by proprietary hardware, according to Aysu.
""Hardware forms the Root of Trust on any given system. Security starts in hardware. Cryptographic solutions typically use dedicated hardware to execute algorithms,"" said Aysu. ""If the hardware leaks information, which it does today, then there is no point in using even the strongest, theoretically secure cryptographic algorithm.""
In two papers published in 2018 [here and here], Aysu and his colleagues explain how ""even theoretically quantum-secure solutions can be broken by a $100 oscilloscope that captures detailed power measurements from hardware,"" Aysu said.
Brian NeSmith, CEO and cofounder of Arctic Wolf Networks, which provides a security operations center (SOC) as a service, said these security concepts are not fully understood by some of the most sophisticated cybersecurity experts, resulting in a dangerous cybersecurity talent gap. In an article published in Forbes in 2018, NeSmith wrote that there are programs ""promoting opportunities in the industry by providing cybersecurity training and certifications"" but these efforts are not generating enough cybersecurity personnel to meet industry needs . For instance, cybersecurity market research firm Cybersecurity Ventures predicts the number of unfilled cybersecurity job openings will triple from 2014 to 3.5 million by 2021; that same year, the firm forecasts black hats (cybercriminals) will be draining $6 trillion annually from economies worldwide.
Robert Herjavec, CEO and founder of cybersecurity product and service provider the Herjavec Group, observes in the company's Cyber Security Jobs Report that ""Until we can rectify the quality of education and training that our cyber experts receive, we will continue to be outpaced by the black hats.""

Men have ever prized technology. But in the larger vista – of improving life – the vast majority of technology that has been developed has not even been a mixed blessing. Instead, technology has been a curse disguised as a benefit. Its evolution has lulled people into the illusion of progress while steadily degrading the natural world and our own lives.
Agricultural technology has lessened the nutrient value of the fruits and vegetables we eat. Modern processed foods have gone so far as to be anti-nutritional.
Modern medicine has fostered the foolish belief that it can cure the ills of the bad food choices and lazy lifestyles that most folk have.
Science has even changed the shape that humans take. The plague of obesity that has worsened worldwide from the last 20th century is a product of technology: processed foods that cater to taste at the expense of nutrition.
The portable electronic devices which became ubiquitous in the early 21st century were intended as conveniences for communication and information usage. These devices have decidedly altered social interaction and etiquette, as their users are often more responsive to their gadgets than the people they are with.
In displacing human interaction with a synthetic substitute which is self-oriented, handheld computers have also encouraged narcissism. Further, language skills decline as these devices require typing on awkward keyboards, and so encourage a pidgin form. LOL!
3 areas of engineering have had the most significant impacts: energy, chemistry, and computers.
The ability of humans to contain and control release of power has had the most profound impact on all that lives on the planet. Most significantly, this capacity afforded means of transport that wove the human world together while tearing the natural world apart.
Materials science culminated in chemistry: manipulation of the molecules which comprise matter. The evolution of these endeavors provided appliances that were used for some short duration before becoming waste, and potent chemicals that were always poisonous pollutants, even those few intended to engender life (for example, plant fertilizers).

The benefits of using a Windows PC
Windows PCs are an excellent choice for those looking for flexibility and familiarity. When choosing a Windows PC, there are more options available in terms of size, shape, and style compared to other systems. From Microsoft’s own “Surface” laptops, tablets and all-in-one PCs to third-party hardware from vendors such as Nvidia graphics cards, individuals can find something to suit their budget. The open ecosystem of the Windows 11 operating system also means users have access to a wide range of applications, software updates, storage options, and more.
The familiarity that users experience with Windows is another major advantage that cannot be overlooked. The user interface closely mimics the way people interact with desktops, which intuitively makes navigation and usage easier than some competing operating systems. Whether it’s productivity apps such as Office 365 or business programs like Visual Studio Code – Windows has something for everyone – making them the perfect choice for anyone looking for advanced functionality from their PC.
Analyzing the security features of both Mac and PC
When looking at comparing the security features of Mac vs PC, one area that stands out is malware and virus protection. For many years now, Windows has been plagued with more virus attacks than the Mac operating system. This is likely because there are so many more Windows users making it a much more attractive platform for attackers to target. As such, Windows PCs need to have specialized antivirus software installed alongside their built-in security functions in order to remain protected from malicious activities.
In contrast, Apple’s macOS generally enjoys a greater level of security as the company has full control over their hardware and software which allows them to easily implement new security measures quickly. While still recommended by professionals, using additional third-party antivirus software is not necessary for the Mac OS as its built-in security features should be adequate on their own. Additionally, since Apple does not allow any major third-party modifications or changes to its core systems this can significantly increase stability as well by eliminating potential issues related to conflicting code between different programs or applications.

"In fact, operators are identified as the culprits in 80 percent of all accidents. Doesn’t this seem odd in this day and age of automation and complex systems? Doesn’t this seem like an easy out on the part of investigators? Rather than play the blame game for whatever reason, organizations should focus on causal factors and address the real issues.
It’s no secret that our world is becoming more complex. Not only does everything from stoves to air conditioners to the space shuttle have electronics and computers, but now they are becoming increasingly integrated into a web of connections creating dependencies and interactions never before dreamed of. However, with all of these interconnections and dependencies come the potential for some serious headaches.
We like to think of ourselves as rational people who live by causality. Simple causality is very straightforward and we cling to it. Simple causality deals with cause and effect — the system overheated and failed. We view this as “because it overheated, the system failed.” This seems easy enough. The truth is that problems aren’t always this simple.
When multiple things fail and interact in ways that, combined, cause the system to fail, this is known as systemic causality. The trick here is that systemic causality does not necessarily need to follow a linear path. Instead, it depends on the failure of multiple components, or subsystems, to interact and fail.
For example, a power failure causing systems to crash seems easy. But, when we dig in we find that there was a UPS (uninterruptible power supply) and generator. The systems should have been protected.
However, we find out that the UPS died earlier than expected due to a couple of space heaters being plugged in on the UPS circuit because an electrician accidentally connected an outlet to the protected power circuit and the heaters only ran during business hours when the staff was present, hence the load was never noticed during regular weekend testing.
To make matters worse, the generator hadn’t been exercised for a long time due to a failure of an electronic remote starter and, hence, the fuel had evaporated and clogged the fuel injection system. Operations didn’t notice because the generator’s monitoring circuit had been erroneous for quite some time and operators discounted what the logs said. To make matters worse, the second generator was down having preventive maintenance performed.
The realistic answer is that nobody could know that all of these independent issues would interact to cause an outage. How would you address this type of scenario?
The hard part, and this is why operators get blamed the most, is that many times the failures in the component systems cause scenarios that were previous unfathomable. If you visit this site and go to the accidents and errors page, you will see a long list of accidents, of which many are blamed on operators. Why? My hunch is that they needed to blame somebody. “We are going to put you into a situation for which you are totally unprepared and see how you do. If you fail, we’ll blame you.” That sure sounds promising, doesn’t it?
So what does this mean? First, vendors and internal groups must place an emphasis on proper design and thorough testing. The testing needs to be formalized and there are software test engineers versed in the proper methodologies. Note, quality must come first, before features, and while testing is a much-needed detective control that assists in ensuring quality, it is not the total solution and must be integrated with the overall system such that feedback is generating process improvement loops. To borrow a phrase from manufacturing — you don’t inspect quality in, you build quality in.
Second, an effective change management process must be in place and followed. There must be detective controls that can assist with the mapping of changes found in production back to authorized change orders. Only authorized changes should be allowed to remain. The ITIL Service Support book and the ITPI Visible Ops methodology provide great guidance here.
Third, we must evolve adaptive processes that rapidly recognize and adapt to variations from the understood mean. This applies not just to application logic, but manual human processes as well. Systems and their operators must be adept at recognizing the need to change and then actually changing in a secure, timely and efficient manner.
Fourth, members of failure review boards must avoid taking the easy way out. Rather than flag the outcome as a result of operator error, ask yourself these two simple questions: “Could anyone have realistically known what to do in that situation?” and “Could anyone have computed the solution and acted in the timeframe allotted?”Quite often, the answer is “no,” which points back to systemic issues that are process and/or technically based.","What would be the most effective approach to implement a new quality control protocol in a manufacturing environment, considering the constraints of reduced budget and limited personnel, while ensuring compliance with regulatory standards?"
"In fact, operators are identified as the culprits in 80 percent of all accidents. Doesn’t this seem odd in this day and age of automation and complex systems? Doesn’t this seem like an easy out on the part of investigators? Rather than play the blame game for whatever reason, organizations should focus on causal factors and address the real issues.
It’s no secret that our world is becoming more complex. Not only does everything from stoves to air conditioners to the space shuttle have electronics and computers, but now they are becoming increasingly integrated into a web of connections creating dependencies and interactions never before dreamed of. However, with all of these interconnections and dependencies come the potential for some serious headaches.
We like to think of ourselves as rational people who live by causality. Simple causality is very straightforward and we cling to it. Simple causality deals with cause and effect — the system overheated and failed. We view this as “because it overheated, the system failed.” This seems easy enough. The truth is that problems aren’t always this simple.
When multiple things fail and interact in ways that, combined, cause the system to fail, this is known as systemic causality. The trick here is that systemic causality does not necessarily need to follow a linear path. Instead, it depends on the failure of multiple components, or subsystems, to interact and fail.
For example, a power failure causing systems to crash seems easy. But, when we dig in we find that there was a UPS (uninterruptible power supply) and generator. The systems should have been protected.
However, we find out that the UPS died earlier than expected due to a couple of space heaters being plugged in on the UPS circuit because an electrician accidentally connected an outlet to the protected power circuit and the heaters only ran during business hours when the staff was present, hence the load was never noticed during regular weekend testing.
To make matters worse, the generator hadn’t been exercised for a long time due to a failure of an electronic remote starter and, hence, the fuel had evaporated and clogged the fuel injection system. Operations didn’t notice because the generator’s monitoring circuit had been erroneous for quite some time and operators discounted what the logs said. To make matters worse, the second generator was down having preventive maintenance performed.
The realistic answer is that nobody could know that all of these independent issues would interact to cause an outage. How would you address this type of scenario?
The hard part, and this is why operators get blamed the most, is that many times the failures in the component systems cause scenarios that were previous unfathomable. If you visit this site and go to the accidents and errors page, you will see a long list of accidents, of which many are blamed on operators. Why? My hunch is that they needed to blame somebody. “We are going to put you into a situation for which you are totally unprepared and see how you do. If you fail, we’ll blame you.” That sure sounds promising, doesn’t it?
So what does this mean? First, vendors and internal groups must place an emphasis on proper design and thorough testing. The testing needs to be formalized and there are software test engineers versed in the proper methodologies. Note, quality must come first, before features, and while testing is a much-needed detective control that assists in ensuring quality, it is not the total solution and must be integrated with the overall system such that feedback is generating process improvement loops.
