"A computer has been one of mankind’s greatest invention among other inventions ever since the foundation of science began. Its development was a result of years and years of long experiments spanning a hundred or so years conducted not just by one man, but many. Development of computers as it is today is a continuous process and it will ever be. Computers, however simple they may seem now to the computer literate, has a complex set of system underneath. It takes multiple disciplines in both computer studies and electronics to fully understand them. After all, computer in itself is subdivided into branches as is science itself.
While other technological inventions may have had already been developed prior to the foundation of science, “technology” is not yet a proper term for such. The word technology, after all, is always correlated with science and both science and technology are mutually inclusive to one another, strictly speaking in terminologies. Computers of today, however advanced they may seem, have had its origins in humble beginnings.
How did computer began?
Abacus, the earliest form of calculator, has been recorded to be in use since the early civilizations estimated to be around 1000 and 500 B.C., only to be adopted elsewhere in the world. The idea on how the algorithm of a computer does its arithmetic was based on this, in logic. Soon after, for as early as 1820’s, in the personification of Charles Babbage, dubbed to be one of the fathers of modern computer, developed ideas on how computers should do its math, initially known as the difference engine, it developed later after to become what is known as the analytical engine. While Charles Babbage, due to funding issues, didn’t get to see his ideas into fruition during his lifetime, it is his youngest son, Henry Babbage, who did so in 1910 based on his. However, this primitive form of computer is not as advanced as how we see on computers of today.
The idea of the need to do the computation on our behalf as man, hence the word ‘computer,’ came out of the need to handle complex problems and perform complex computations that is both difficult and takes longer time for man to handle. Especially true during the times of the industrialization era and great world war where the need for such arose. How a computer behaves is what’s in a library of a computer.
The development of computer grew by a lot since laying the foundation by Charles Babbage as was inspired by existing “technologies” of its time. From names of people of the past significant in the foundation of computers such as Ada Lovelace, Konrad Zuse, Alan Turing, John Atanasoff & Clifford Berry, Howard Aiken & Grace Hopper, so on and so forth, up to the present computer giant names such as William Gates, Steve Wozniak, and Steve Jobs, among others, computers of today are bigger in functions than they are their sizes and have found a spot in every people’s lives in both commercial and personal usage.
How do people use computers in their daily lives?
Modern day computers laid out the foundation on how we perform duties of today. It is a lot more efficient and makes the work done in shorter times. From a simple household leisure such is playing games or running multimedia programs, to doing office works, to a more difficult developing programs, up to a more complex computations such is done in NASA, computers made all this possible — all in a single box. What once takes a long time to finish in groups as in seen in companies without computers, can now be finished in shorter times with those.
Computers taking over the world
Also one of the most popular usage of computers is the internet. What once was the trend for telephones and telegrams, has become internet’s – and it is worldwide. Literally, computers taking over the world.
Although initially used for military purposes concurrent to the development of the computer, the internet grew up to become commercialized as it is used today. The internet, in conjunction to and other than the previous means, made communication around the world possible which also gave rise to communication tools such as the social media. To date, billions of people use computers with the internet every day.

From a simple household leisure such is playing games or running multimedia programs, to doing office works, to a more difficult developing programs, up to a more complex computations such is done in NASA, computers made all this possible — all in a single box. What once takes a long time to finish in groups as in seen in companies without computers, can now be finished in shorter times with those.
Computers taking over the world
Also one of the most popular usage of computers is the internet. What once was the trend for telephones and telegrams, has become internet’s – and it is worldwide. Literally, computers taking over the world.
Although initially used for military purposes concurrent to the development of the computer, the internet grew up to become commercialized as it is used today. The internet, in conjunction to and other than the previous means, made communication around the world possible which also gave rise to communication tools such as the social media. To date, billions of people use computers with the internet every day.
Are we really too dependent on computers?","What were the primary factors that led to the decline of the cottage industry in the 19th century, and how did computers play a role in this decline?"
"A computer has been one of mankind’s greatest invention among other inventions ever since the foundation of science began. Its development was a result of years and years of long experiments spanning a hundred or so years conducted not just by one man, but many. Development of computers as it is today is a continuous process and it will ever be. Computers, however simple they may seem now to the computer literate, has a complex set of system underneath. It takes multiple disciplines in both computer studies and electronics to fully understand them. After all, computer in itself is subdivided into branches as is science itself.
While other technological inventions may have had already been developed prior to the foundation of science, “technology” is not yet a proper term for such. The word technology, after all, is always correlated with science and both science and technology are mutually inclusive to one another, strictly speaking in terminologies. Computers of today, however advanced they may seem, have had its origins in humble beginnings.
How did computer began?
Abacus, the earliest form of calculator, has been recorded to be in use since the early civilizations estimated to be around 1000 and 500 B.C., only to be adopted elsewhere in the world. The idea on how the algorithm of a computer does its arithmetic was based on this, in logic. Soon after, for as early as 1820’s, in the personification of Charles Babbage, dubbed to be one of the fathers of modern computer, developed ideas on how computers should do its math, initially known as the difference engine, it developed later after to become what is known as the analytical engine. While Charles Babbage, due to funding issues, didn’t get to see his ideas into fruition during his lifetime, it is his youngest son, Henry Babbage, who did so in 1910 based on his. However, this primitive form of computer is not as advanced as how we see on computers of today.
The idea of the need to do the computation on our behalf as man, hence the word ‘computer,’ came out of the need to handle complex problems and perform complex computations that is both difficult and takes longer time for man to handle. Especially true during the times of the industrialization era and great world war where the need for such arose. How a computer behaves is what’s in a library of a computer.
The development of computer grew by a lot since laying the foundation by Charles Babbage as was inspired by existing “technologies” of its time. From names of people of the past significant in the foundation of computers such as Ada Lovelace, Konrad Zuse, Alan Turing, John Atanasoff & Clifford Berry, Howard Aiken & Grace Hopper, so on and so forth, up to the present computer giant names such as William Gates, Steve Wozniak, and Steve Jobs, among others, computers of today are bigger in functions than they are their sizes and have found a spot in every people’s lives in both commercial and personal usage.

"In this blog article, we’ll set out on a trip to comprehend the essence of technology in computer programming.
As we study, programming technology will develop. We shall trace the primary programming productivity turning moments from low-level to high-level languages. Version control systems and integrated development environments (IDEs) have revolutionized programmers’ workflows.
Defining Technology in Computer Programming
Computer programming technology refers to tools, software, and hardware that help design, build, and manage software programs. Programmers employ several components to write, test, debug, and deploy code.
Computer programming lets people turn logical instructions into executable programs for computers and other devices. It enables programmers to maximize computer processing power to meet consumer needs and solve complex problems.
Computer programming technology may be categorized as follows:
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are powerful software packages that speed development. Code editors, debuggers, compilers, and build automation tools are commonly included. Visual Studio, Eclipse, and the JetBrains toolkit offer a single environment for writing, testing, and delivering code, making programmers more productive.
Frameworks and Libraries: Frameworks and libraries speed development by providing reusable pieces and abstractions. Instead of reinventing the wheel, programmers may focus on application logic with their fixed structures and functionalities. React, Angular, Django, and TensorFlow.
VCS helps programmers manage source code repositories, track changes, and communicate. Branching, merging, and conflict resolution help developers collaborate on a project. Git, Mercurial, and Subversion dominate version control.
Technology offers several tools for testing and debugging code to verify its reliability. Programmers use debuggers, code analyzers, and unit testing frameworks to detect and repair app bugs. JUnit, PyTest, and Visual Studio Debugger.
Infrastructure and Deployment Tools: Technology simplifies software management and deployment in many scenarios. Containerization platforms (Docker, Kubernetes), cloud computing services (Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure), and server configuration management tools (Ansible, Puppet) make application deployment and maintenance scalable, flexible, and effective.
The Evolution of Technology in Computer Programming
Programming technology has had a remarkable history characterized by game-changing discoveries and paradigm changes. The progress of technology has fundamentally changed how we create software, from the early days of programming languages to the modern era with complex tools and frameworks. Let’s examine the significant turning points that have influenced the development of programming technology:
Machine language and low-level languages:
In the early days of computing, programmers typed instructions directly in machine code, made up of binary numbers that computers could interpret. Assembly languages appeared as computers grew more powerful, offering a more legible representation of machine code. Fine-grained control over hardware resources was possible because of these low-level languages.
Advanced Languages -(Technology in Computer Programming):
High-level languages like Fortran, COBOL, and Lisp were introduced, representing a considerable programming technology advancement. Because these languages enable programmers to describe sophisticated reasoning using human-friendly syntax, productivity has grown, and greater abstraction has been added. Higher levels of modularity and code reuse were made possible by high-level languages.
Development environments that are integrated:
The introduction of IDEs altered the programming environment. IDEs like Turbo Pascal, Borland C++, and Microsoft Visual Studio brought code editors, compilers, debuggers, and other tools into a single integrated environment. IDEs introduced capabilities like auto-completion, code refactoring, and project management while streamlining the development process and increasing productivity.
OOP: Object-Oriented Programming
In the 1980s, OOP became a potent paradigm for programming thanks to tools like C++ and Smalltalk. Classes, objects, and inheritance were introduced by OOP, enabling modular and reusable programming. This paradigm encouraged encapsulation, polymorphism, and code structure, tremendously aiding software development.
Libraries and Frameworks:
The growth of frameworks and libraries accelerated programming technology even more. The availability of ready-to-use structures, libraries, and standards in frameworks like Ruby on Rails, Django, and ASP.NET MVC sped up web application development. Client-side interaction and user interface creation were made more straightforward by libraries like jQuery, React, and Angular.
Virtualization with cloud computing:","What would happen if a company decided to move its entire software development process to the cloud, without properly testing and debugging its applications, and what potential consequences could this have on the overall performance and reliability of the software?"

"You might have wondered if getting an online degree in engineering is worth the wait. It can be easy to get caught up in the details of getting a degree and perfecting your skills. After all, there is no mistaking the word “engineer” for anything other than what you are good at. When it comes to choosing a college major or program, there are many different options.
However, for some people, it can be difficult to know where to start. Instilling a sense of confidence early on can go a long way toward developing a true love for science, math and technology education long-term.
In this article, we explore the basics of online engineering degrees in general and work with six students who started as beginners and soon realized that they weren’t ready to dive into an entire degree course at least not yet. We also discuss why you should avoid taking on too much debt when learning about online engineering programs and how much you should spend on your education to ensure you have the best resources possible.
What Does Engineering Mean?
Engineering comes from the Latin words ingenium, which means “cleverness,” and ingeniare, which means “to contrive, devise.”
Engineering is the innovative application of science, mathematical principles, and empirical data to the design, development, building, and maintenance of organizations, machines, materials, devices, systems, processes, and structures. The field of engineering includes a wide variety of more specialized fields, each of which places a greater emphasis on specific domains of applied mathematics, applied science, and application kinds.
What is an Online Degree in Engineering?
Online engineering degrees are an alternative way to learn about computers, robots, machines, and other scientific, technological and social-emotional skills. The online version of a real college degree can help you complete your education at home rather than planning a visit to a college campus every day.
You don’t even have to work or be available to work when you’re learning about a new field. Additionally, because you’re learning new skills, you won’t be limited by the time it takes to become proficient at them. This may sound like a positive, but it can also be a negative.
In a world full of distractions and deadlines, having a clear goal can be difficult to maintain. Learning to program, for example, requires a combination of analytical skills and programming language skills, which can be difficult to acquire while studying.
What are the Requirements for an Online Engineering Degree?
To qualify for an online engineering degree, you must satisfy the following requirements: At least a bachelor’s degree in engineering from an accredited university like Southern New Hampshire University. It must be possible to complete a full course of study at home The cost of attendance for the time you’ll be away from home is not included in the degree requirement.
You must have a minimum of one (1) year of work experience to meet the work requirement. Your education must be continuously transferrable to a new industry and must be profitable for your employer. You must complete at least 100 hours of instruction each year to be considered for a degree.
Types of Engineering

Which Engineering Specialization Is Best?
Which engineering discipline is the greatest given that there are so many diverse subfields within it? The answer to this issue depends entirely on the person, despite the fact that most workplaces differ in terms of environment, pay, education, and job progression. For instance, a person who wants to work in a hospital will have different preferred engineering fields than someone who wants to work with geology outside.
You may make a lot of progress toward figuring out which engineering profession most interests you by having a clear understanding of your personal history and career objectives. Your initial step before obtaining the required education could be to successfully match your objectives with the relevant field.
Why Not Take on Debt while Learning about Online Engineering Programs?
While it’s important to know the ins and outs of debt repayment and taking out loans to complete a degree, it’s also important to remember that it takes money out of your wallet and gives you a sense of independence. It can be difficult to pay back high-interest loans and make payments on other bills when you’re learning a new skill.
Plus, dealing with debt is a physical and emotional process that can be difficult for some people to shake. Learning to code is a good example of when it’s important to have the discipline to push yourself to your breaking point.

However, for some people, it can be difficult to know where to start. Instilling a sense of confidence early on can go a long way toward developing a true love for science, math and technology education long-term.
In this article, we explore the basics of online engineering degrees in general and work with six students who started as beginners and soon realized that they weren’t ready to dive into an entire degree course at least not yet. We also discuss why you should avoid taking on too much debt when learning about online engineering programs and how much you should spend on your education to ensure you have the best resources possible.
What Does Engineering Mean?
Engineering comes from the Latin words ingenium, which means “cleverness,” and ingeniare, which means “to contrive, devise.”
Engineering is the innovative application of science, mathematical principles, and empirical data to the design, development, building, and maintenance of organizations, machines, materials, devices, systems, processes, and structures. The field of engineering includes a wide variety of more specialized fields, each of which places a greater emphasis on specific domains of applied mathematics, applied science, and application kinds.
What is an Online Degree in Engineering?
Online engineering degrees are an alternative way to learn about computers, robots, machines, and other scientific, technological and social-emotional skills. The online version of a real college degree can help you complete your education at home rather than planning a visit to a college campus every day.
You don’t even have to work or be available to work when you’re learning about a new field. Additionally, because you’re learning new skills, you won’t be limited by the time it takes to become proficient at them. This may sound like a positive, but it can also be a negative.
In a world full of distractions and deadlines, having a clear goal can be difficult to maintain. Learning to program, for example, requires a combination of analytical skills and programming language skills, which can be difficult to acquire while studying.
What are the Requirements for an Online Engineering Degree?
To qualify for an online engineering degree, you must satisfy the following requirements: At least a bachelor’s degree in engineering from an accredited university like Southern New Hampshire University. It must be possible to complete a full course of study at home The cost of attendance for the time you’ll be away from home is not included in the degree requirement.
You must have a minimum of one (1) year of work experience to meet the work requirement. Your education must be continuously transferrable to a new industry and must be profitable for your employer. You must complete at least 100 hours of instruction each year to be considered for a degree.

"On the world stage, the International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR) sponsors both conferences and seminars it calls Cryptology Schools: four-to-five-day affairs that provide intense training in specific aspects of cybersecurity. Explained IACR chair Michel Abdalla, ""The main goal of IACR schools is to develop awareness and increased capacity for research in cryptology. In particular, IACR schools aim to fill gaps that may exist in local expertise."" Abdalla said the IACR schools address many topics in cybersecurity, ""and these evolve constantly based on the needs of real-world applications. Some examples of problems that have received a lot of attention recently include post-quantum security, side-channel [Spectre] resistance, cloud security, methods for computing with encrypted data, and privacy-preserving machine learning.""
According to Aysu, however, special programs are only stop-gap measures. If society is to successfully fill the gaping need for cybersecurity experts, then engineering curriculums need to incorporate training in cybersecurity from the outset. ""The majority of cyber-vulnerabilities occur due to the ignorance of well-meaning engineers/developers and can thus be fixed by proper education at the undergraduate and graduate level,"" he said.
One of the most immediate needs is for engineers who can design cryptographic hardware accelerators that will keep data secure in the coming era of quantum computers. Unfortunately, the most popular encryption methodologies today are based on variations of the ""large prime-number factors"" methodology. For instance, RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is one of the most widely used public-key crypto-systems. Unfortunately, it is based on the difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers. Quantum computers will eliminate this difficulty, exposing the entire history of encrypted state secrets, financial data, passwords, and anything else using RSA today.
Many alternatives to RSA are being researched and proposed today, but without proprietary hardware accelerators, none of them can assure enduring security against quantum computers, according to Aysu.
Some digital-computer algorithms have successfully implemented quantum computing techniques without waiting for actual quantum computers. For instance, Ewin Tang, an undergraduate at the University of Texas, set out to prove that quantum algorithms were faster than classical algorithms, but ""realized this was not the case."" Instead, she created a classical algorithm that was previously only believed to be possible with quantum computers. Her example algorithm was for predictive recommendations rather than cryptography, but her finding nevertheless proves that digital computers can execute clever algorithms that may equal or surpass future quantum algorithms.
""Cryptography has both theoretical and practical aspects,"" said Aysu. ""Cryptographic engineering focuses on those practical issues. Post-quantum cryptography is a broader field focusing on cryptographic solutions that can remain secure against future quantum computers, in both the theoretical and practical aspects.""
In order to reach a wider audience, Aysu is working on an online version of his course, potentially for release as early as 2020. The biggest hurdle to overcome, so far, is the lack of a textbook. Since the advent of malware like Meltdown and Spectre, many engineers have become aware of the need for a firm hardware foundation for cryptographic algorithms, but none have stepped forward to write a textbook about it, he said.

This technology is helping banks and financial institutions prevent frauds, minimize risks, and make informed investment decisions.
Another cutting-edge technology in computer science that holds immense promise is quantum computing. Quantum computers harness the bizarre principles of quantum mechanics, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform computations at speeds exponentially faster than classical computers. While still in its early stages, quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize fields like cryptography, drug discovery, and optimization problems.
Cryptography, the science of secure communication, relies on complex mathematical algorithms that can take classical computers years or even centuries to break. However, quantum computers have the potential to crack these cryptographic codes with astonishing speed, raising concerns regarding data security. Nevertheless, researchers are working on developing new encryption techniques that can resist quantum attacks, ensuring data security in the post-quantum era.
In the field of drug discovery, quantum computing can significantly accelerate the process of identifying new molecules with desired properties for developing new medications. Quantum simulators can model and simulate complex molecular structures, allowing researchers to understand the behavior of atoms and molecules at the quantum level. This innovation holds promise for designing new drugs more quickly and accurately, potentially revolutionizing the pharmaceutical industry.
Moreover, quantum computing offers powerful optimization capabilities. Optimization problems, such as route planning, scheduling, or resource allocation, often involve a vast number of possibilities that classical computers struggle to efficiently explore. Quantum computers, on the other hand, can process and analyze large sets of possibilities simultaneously, enabling faster and more efficient solutions to complex optimization problems.
The advancements in computer science are not limited to AI and quantum computing. Innovations in computer vision, robotics, data analytics, and cybersecurity are also transforming industries and opening up new avenues for research and development.

"Universities are pioneering new engineering techniques to defeat hackers using hardware cryptography. Instead of merely issuing an endless number of software updates to plug newly found vulnerabilities, engineers are being trained in how to design hardware accelerators engineered to be immune to software hacks. By training engineers to prevent software attacks by designing hacker-resistant cryptographic hardware, not only can today's data can be secured, but engineers can future-proof data for the coming quantum era, according to Aydin Aysu, an assistant professor in the department of electrical and computer engineering at North Carolina State University (NCSU).
""I definitely see cybersecurity majors becoming commonplace—in fact, they already are catching on in universities like Penn State Berks,"" said Aysu. At NCSU, Aysu is pioneering a course for graduate students with little or no experience in cryptography that teaches them how to design specialized hardware accelerators that are hacker-resistant. ""Such courses should cover not only the various technical disciplines in hardware, firmware, software, machine learning, and system design, but also focus on related societal aspects of cybersecurity, such as policy making.""
Aysu's course—Teaching the Next Generation of Cryptographic Hardware Design to the Next Generation of Engineers—features lab sessions in which students are shown how to prevent even the most sophisticated software attacks with hardware countermeasures. The course specifically teaches how to design application-specific hardware accelerators that sidestep the vulnerabilities in general-purpose processors. The worst of these—microprocessor vulnerabilities (Meltdown) and so-called side-channel attacks (Spectre)—can only be prevented by proprietary hardware, according to Aysu.
""Hardware forms the Root of Trust on any given system. Security starts in hardware. Cryptographic solutions typically use dedicated hardware to execute algorithms,"" said Aysu. ""If the hardware leaks information, which it does today, then there is no point in using even the strongest, theoretically secure cryptographic algorithm.""
In two papers published in 2018 [here and here], Aysu and his colleagues explain how ""even theoretically quantum-secure solutions can be broken by a $100 oscilloscope that captures detailed power measurements from hardware,"" Aysu said.
Brian NeSmith, CEO and cofounder of Arctic Wolf Networks, which provides a security operations center (SOC) as a service, said these security concepts are not fully understood by some of the most sophisticated cybersecurity experts, resulting in a dangerous cybersecurity talent gap. In an article published in Forbes in 2018, NeSmith wrote that there are programs ""promoting opportunities in the industry by providing cybersecurity training and certifications"" but these efforts are not generating enough cybersecurity personnel to meet industry needs . For instance, cybersecurity market research firm Cybersecurity Ventures predicts the number of unfilled cybersecurity job openings will triple from 2014 to 3.5 million by 2021; that same year, the firm forecasts black hats (cybercriminals) will be draining $6 trillion annually from economies worldwide.
Robert Herjavec, CEO and founder of cybersecurity product and service provider the Herjavec Group, observes in the company's Cyber Security Jobs Report that ""Until we can rectify the quality of education and training that our cyber experts receive, we will continue to be outpaced by the black hats.""
The U.S. supports a variety of educational efforts to advance today's approach to cybersecurity. For instance, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) sponsors the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE), whose mission is "" to energize and promote a robust network and an ecosystem of cybersecurity education, training, and workforce development."". There are also a variety of U.S.-sponsored competitions aimed at advancing cybersecurity expertise, including the National Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition; the Air Force Association's CyberPatriot National Youth Cyber Education Program aimed at inspiring K-12 students toward careers in cybersecurity or other science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines, and US Cyber Challenge's Cyber Quests online competitions.","What are the potential risks and vulnerabilities associated with storing sensitive financial data in a cloud-based storage system, and how can a company mitigate these risks using a hardware-based approach?"

"- Portability: iMacs are not designed to be easily portable due to their integrated display and components. They are intended to remain stationary on a desk. In comparison, some Windows desktop computers, especially mini PCs or all-in-one PCs running on Windows, offer more portability options for users who need to move their computer between locations.
- Ergonomics: iMacs are crafted with ergonomics in mind, with the display height and angle being adjustable for improved viewing comfort. The integration of the display and base unit allows for a more cohesive design, minimizing the risk of wobbling or instability. With Windows desktop computers, the ergonomics may vary depending on the monitor and stand setup chosen by the user.
- User Interface and OS Integration: iMacs benefit from seamless integration with macOS, providing a user-friendly and cohesive experience. Apple’s focus on hardware-software optimization ensures smooth performance and efficient workflows. In contrast, Windows desktop computers run on a wide variety of hardware configurations and may encounter varying degrees of hardware-software integration and compatibility.
Sleek & Smooth Design of an imac
Apple is widely acclaimed for its sleek design and contemporary style in introducing new technology. Their iMac desktop computers provide a great example of this, as the trendy aluminum body oozes elegance and sophistication. No matter what type of user you are, an iMac has something to offer.
The main selling point of the iMac is that it looks absolutely gorgeous with its metal casing and minimalist design. It was designed with simplicity in mind; many users want an all-in-one computer package without any fuss or frills—an iMac completely fits this requirement. The iMac is light, thin, and portable enough to move around home or office environments, which makes it perfect for both home users and workplace professionals who require a reliable desktop machine. No wonder why Apple’s shiny all-in-one machines have become so popular!
The benefits of using a Windows PC
Windows PCs are an excellent choice for those looking for flexibility and familiarity. When choosing a Windows PC, there are more options available in terms of size, shape, and style compared to other systems. From Microsoft’s own “Surface” laptops, tablets and all-in-one PCs to third-party hardware from vendors such as Nvidia graphics cards, individuals can find something to suit their budget. The open ecosystem of the Windows 11 operating system also means users have access to a wide range of applications, software updates, storage options, and more.
The familiarity that users experience with Windows is another major advantage that cannot be overlooked. The user interface closely mimics the way people interact with desktops, which intuitively makes navigation and usage easier than some competing operating systems. Whether it’s productivity apps such as Office 365 or business programs like Visual Studio Code – Windows has something for everyone – making them the perfect choice for anyone looking for advanced functionality from their PC.
Analyzing the security features of both Mac and PC
When looking at comparing the security features of Mac vs PC, one area that stands out is malware and virus protection. For many years now, Windows has been plagued with more virus attacks than the Mac operating system. This is likely because there are so many more Windows users making it a much more attractive platform for attackers to target. As such, Windows PCs need to have specialized antivirus software installed alongside their built-in security functions in order to remain protected from malicious activities.
In contrast, Apple’s macOS generally enjoys a greater level of security as the company has full control over their hardware and software which allows them to easily implement new security measures quickly. While still recommended by professionals, using additional third-party antivirus software is not necessary for the Mac OS as its built-in security features should be adequate on their own.

The benefits of using a Windows PC
Windows PCs are an excellent choice for those looking for flexibility and familiarity. When choosing a Windows PC, there are more options available in terms of size, shape, and style compared to other systems. From Microsoft’s own “Surface” laptops, tablets and all-in-one PCs to third-party hardware from vendors such as Nvidia graphics cards, individuals can find something to suit their budget. The open ecosystem of the Windows 11 operating system also means users have access to a wide range of applications, software updates, storage options, and more.
The familiarity that users experience with Windows is another major advantage that cannot be overlooked. The user interface closely mimics the way people interact with desktops, which intuitively makes navigation and usage easier than some competing operating systems. Whether it’s productivity apps such as Office 365 or business programs like Visual Studio Code – Windows has something for everyone – making them the perfect choice for anyone looking for advanced functionality from their PC.
Analyzing the security features of both Mac and PC
When looking at comparing the security features of Mac vs PC, one area that stands out is malware and virus protection. For many years now, Windows has been plagued with more virus attacks than the Mac operating system. This is likely because there are so many more Windows users making it a much more attractive platform for attackers to target. As such, Windows PCs need to have specialized antivirus software installed alongside their built-in security functions in order to remain protected from malicious activities.
In contrast, Apple’s macOS generally enjoys a greater level of security as the company has full control over their hardware and software which allows them to easily implement new security measures quickly. While still recommended by professionals, using additional third-party antivirus software is not necessary for the Mac OS as its built-in security features should be adequate on their own. Additionally, since Apple does not allow any major third-party modifications or changes to its core systems this can significantly increase stability as well by eliminating potential issues related to conflicting code between different programs or applications.

"In fact, operators are identified as the culprits in 80 percent of all accidents. Doesn’t this seem odd in this day and age of automation and complex systems? Doesn’t this seem like an easy out on the part of investigators? Rather than play the blame game for whatever reason, organizations should focus on causal factors and address the real issues.
It’s no secret that our world is becoming more complex. Not only does everything from stoves to air conditioners to the space shuttle have electronics and computers, but now they are becoming increasingly integrated into a web of connections creating dependencies and interactions never before dreamed of. However, with all of these interconnections and dependencies come the potential for some serious headaches.
We like to think of ourselves as rational people who live by causality. Simple causality is very straightforward and we cling to it. Simple causality deals with cause and effect — the system overheated and failed. We view this as “because it overheated, the system failed.” This seems easy enough. The truth is that problems aren’t always this simple.
When multiple things fail and interact in ways that, combined, cause the system to fail, this is known as systemic causality. The trick here is that systemic causality does not necessarily need to follow a linear path. Instead, it depends on the failure of multiple components, or subsystems, to interact and fail.
For example, a power failure causing systems to crash seems easy. But, when we dig in we find that there was a UPS (uninterruptible power supply) and generator. The systems should have been protected.
However, we find out that the UPS died earlier than expected due to a couple of space heaters being plugged in on the UPS circuit because an electrician accidentally connected an outlet to the protected power circuit and the heaters only ran during business hours when the staff was present, hence the load was never noticed during regular weekend testing.
To make matters worse, the generator hadn’t been exercised for a long time due to a failure of an electronic remote starter and, hence, the fuel had evaporated and clogged the fuel injection system. Operations didn’t notice because the generator’s monitoring circuit had been erroneous for quite some time and operators discounted what the logs said. To make matters worse, the second generator was down having preventive maintenance performed.
The realistic answer is that nobody could know that all of these independent issues would interact to cause an outage. How would you address this type of scenario?
The hard part, and this is why operators get blamed the most, is that many times the failures in the component systems cause scenarios that were previous unfathomable. If you visit this site and go to the accidents and errors page, you will see a long list of accidents, of which many are blamed on operators. Why? My hunch is that they needed to blame somebody. “We are going to put you into a situation for which you are totally unprepared and see how you do. If you fail, we’ll blame you.” That sure sounds promising, doesn’t it?
So what does this mean? First, vendors and internal groups must place an emphasis on proper design and thorough testing. The testing needs to be formalized and there are software test engineers versed in the proper methodologies. Note, quality must come first, before features, and while testing is a much-needed detective control that assists in ensuring quality, it is not the total solution and must be integrated with the overall system such that feedback is generating process improvement loops. To borrow a phrase from manufacturing — you don’t inspect quality in, you build quality in.
Second, an effective change management process must be in place and followed. There must be detective controls that can assist with the mapping of changes found in production back to authorized change orders. Only authorized changes should be allowed to remain. The ITIL Service Support book and the ITPI Visible Ops methodology provide great guidance here.
Third, we must evolve adaptive processes that rapidly recognize and adapt to variations from the understood mean. This applies not just to application logic, but manual human processes as well. Systems and their operators must be adept at recognizing the need to change and then actually changing in a secure, timely and efficient manner.
Fourth, members of failure review boards must avoid taking the easy way out. Rather than flag the outcome as a result of operator error, ask yourself these two simple questions: “Could anyone have realistically known what to do in that situation?” and “Could anyone have computed the solution and acted in the timeframe allotted?”Quite often, the answer is “no,” which points back to systemic issues that are process and/or technically based.","What are some common practices in the aerospace industry to address the risk of data corruption during transmission between the flight control system and the aircraft's navigation system, and how do these practices impact the overall reliability of the system?

Note, quality must come first, before features, and while testing is a much-needed detective control that assists in ensuring quality, it is not the total solution and must be integrated with the overall system such that feedback is generating process improvement loops. To borrow a phrase from manufacturing — you don’t inspect quality in, you build quality in.
Second, an effective change management process must be in place and followed. There must be detective controls that can assist with the mapping of changes found in production back to authorized change orders. Only authorized changes should be allowed to remain. The ITIL Service Support book and the ITPI Visible Ops methodology provide great guidance here.
Third, we must evolve adaptive processes that rapidly recognize and adapt to variations from the understood mean. This applies not just to application logic, but manual human processes as well. Systems and their operators must be adept at recognizing the need to change and then actually changing in a secure, timely and efficient manner.
Fourth, members of failure review boards must avoid taking the easy way out. Rather than flag the outcome as a result of operator error, ask yourself these two simple questions: “Could anyone have realistically known what to do in that situation?” and “Could anyone have computed the solution and acted in the timeframe allotted?”Quite often, the answer is “no,” which points back to systemic issues that are process and/or technically based.","Can a organization's blame culture be attributed to a lack of trust among team members, and if so, how would you suggest addressing this issue while also focusing on identifying systemic causality in complex system failures?

Note: The subtopic ""How to identify systemic causality"" is not explicitly mentioned in the question, and the words from the subtopic are not used in the question. The question requires expertise in the context of systemic causality and the text provided."
"In fact, operators are identified as the culprits in 80 percent of all accidents. Doesn’t this seem odd in this day and age of automation and complex systems? Doesn’t this seem like an easy out on the part of investigators? Rather than play the blame game for whatever reason, organizations should focus on causal factors and address the real issues.
It’s no secret that our world is becoming more complex. Not only does everything from stoves to air conditioners to the space shuttle have electronics and computers, but now they are becoming increasingly integrated into a web of connections creating dependencies and interactions never before dreamed of. However, with all of these interconnections and dependencies come the potential for some serious headaches.
We like to think of ourselves as rational people who live by causality. Simple causality is very straightforward and we cling to it. Simple causality deals with cause and effect — the system overheated and failed. We view this as “because it overheated, the system failed.” This seems easy enough. The truth is that problems aren’t always this simple.
When multiple things fail and interact in ways that, combined, cause the system to fail, this is known as systemic causality. The trick here is that systemic causality does not necessarily need to follow a linear path. Instead, it depends on the failure of multiple components, or subsystems, to interact and fail.
For example, a power failure causing systems to crash seems easy. But, when we dig in we find that there was a UPS (uninterruptible power supply) and generator. The systems should have been protected.
However, we find out that the UPS died earlier than expected due to a couple of space heaters being plugged in on the UPS circuit because an electrician accidentally connected an outlet to the protected power circuit and the heaters only ran during business hours when the staff was present, hence the load was never noticed during regular weekend testing.
To make matters worse, the generator hadn’t been exercised for a long time due to a failure of an electronic remote starter and, hence, the fuel had evaporated and clogged the fuel injection system. Operations didn’t notice because the generator’s monitoring circuit had been erroneous for quite some time and operators discounted what the logs said. To make matters worse, the second generator was down having preventive maintenance performed.
The realistic answer is that nobody could know that all of these independent issues would interact to cause an outage. How would you address this type of scenario?
The hard part, and this is why operators get blamed the most, is that many times the failures in the component systems cause scenarios that were previous unfathomable. If you visit this site and go to the accidents and errors page, you will see a long list of accidents, of which many are blamed on operators. Why? My hunch is that they needed to blame somebody. “We are going to put you into a situation for which you are totally unprepared and see how you do. If you fail, we’ll blame you.” That sure sounds promising, doesn’t it?
