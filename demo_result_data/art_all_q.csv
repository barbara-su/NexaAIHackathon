"The Value of Visual Arts Education: Cultivating Creativity and Expression
In an increasingly digital world, the importance of visual arts education may be overshadowed by other subjects deemed more practical or academic. However, the value of this form of education should not be underestimated. Visual arts education plays a pivotal role in cultivating creativity and expression, which are essential skills for personal growth and success in various fields.
First and foremost, visual arts education allows individuals to tap into their creativity and imagination. From a young age, children are naturally drawn to colors, shapes, and visual stimuli. By engaging in visual arts activities, such as drawing, painting, or sculpture, students are encouraged to explore their ideas and thoughts in a visual form. This creative process enables students to think outside the box, develop original ideas, and problem-solve in innovative ways. These skills extend beyond the realm of arts and can be applied in various professional settings, such as business, science, and technology. Creativity is the driving force behind inventions, new discoveries, and artistic expression. Visual arts education instills this crucial skill in students, preparing them for a rapidly evolving world.
Moreover, visual arts education provides an outlet for self-expression and emotional release. Art has the power to communicate feelings and ideas that may be difficult to express through words alone. By engaging in visual arts activities, individuals are given a platform to express their thoughts, emotions, and experiences. This process not only enhances emotional intelligence but also fosters empathy and understanding. Through visual arts education, students learn to communicate and connect with others on a deeper level. These interpersonal skills are essential in building strong relationships, collaborating effectively, and understanding diverse perspectives.
Furthermore, visual arts education fosters critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. When engaging in art-making, students are faced with decisions about composition, colors, and materials. They learn to analyze, evaluate, and make informed choices to achieve their desired outcome. This process encourages students to think critically, solve problems creatively, and experiment with different techniques and approaches. These skills are highly transferable and are prized in many professional fields. Employers increasingly look for individuals who can think critically, adapt to new situations, and propose innovative solutions. Visual arts education equips individuals with these skills, making them more competitive in the job market.
Lastly, visual arts education promotes cultural and historical awareness. Art is a reflection of society, culture, and history. Through studying and creating art, individuals gain insights into different periods, civilizations, and artistic movements. This understanding of art history and cultural diversity not only enriches their perspective but also promotes tolerance and appreciation for different cultures and traditions. Visual arts education encourages individuals to ask questions, challenge assumptions, and engage in dialogues about social issues. It fosters open-mindedness and empathy, qualities that are increasingly needed in an interconnected and multicultural world.
In conclusion, visual arts education holds immense value in cultivating creativity and expression. It encourages individuals to think outside the box, express themselves, and develop critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. Furthermore, visual arts education promotes cultural awareness and empathy, fostering a more inclusive and tolerant society. As such, it is crucial to invest in and prioritize visual arts education as an integral part of a well-rounded and comprehensive education system.

"03 Nov Speaking Through Art
by Barbara K. Stump, MA
For over 30 years, I always found a space in my classroom to display one particular poster. It was a black and white photograph of a child drawing, and the caption read, “Art is the First Language.” I loved that poster, the simplicity and the earnest look on the child’s face drawing big curvy lines. This poster never felt outdated and was mesmerizing. I feel the point of this poster was to say, we can all engage in art in one way or another as a viewer, a creator, or both! So, why should we? What are the benefits of art?
The last two years have been unusual for all of us. Teaching through the pandemic helped me realize how important my role as a teacher was for my students. Art was challenging to teach online. However, I was impressed with the way my students “showed up” for class. In order to meet the unique needs of teaching art virtually, my colleagues and I worked diligently to assemble art kits for students to use at home for painting, drawing, jewelry, and even ceramics.
Entering my students’ homes, via google meet sessions, was enlightening. Sometimes students would be babysitting their younger siblings, and they would ask if their siblings could also participate in the lesson. Other times, I would see parents “peek” in to see what was going on virtually and ask questions about materials. Often at the end of each hour, I would have one or two students remaining online wanting to share their work with me, or even just to talk to me.
When we returned to in person classes, the students were different. My classes were quieter, and learning to be in person again was an adjustment. Something else had changed, students became more personal in their artwork. I always had a few students who shared things they observed, or worried about, but this time students were sharing more personal life events. I had students openly, through their artwork, visually describe their feelings about losing a parent, family addictions, trauma, anxiety, and gender issues. The most positive thing about it was students were overall more acceptive and less judgemental of each other. The Art Studio provided a safe place for these people to vent and produce some wonderful artwork.
Think for a moment, what do you enjoy most about art? Do you display it in your home? Do you like to create? Do you like to explore new places and cultures? Do you enjoy being creative through painting, drawing, cooking, gardening, music, theater, writing, photography, etc..? Did you rediscover your creative side during the pandemic? I think many people did rediscover their creative selves during that time at home, even if it included doing some home improvements! People from all walks of life and all ages are taking the time to include art in one way or another into their life. By doing this I believe people are discovering the benefits.
Recently I polled my Instagram followers, and asked the question, why do you enjoy art? Here are a few responses:
“I love how art conveys thoughts, emotions, and feelings that words can’t express. It makes me happy.”; “I love how you can make anything into art, like nature (pics, driftwood, etc..)”; “Art brings me joy. I love being creative and making things.”; “There are no limits. You can express yourself in ways words may not.”; “Creativity”; and “I can create an entire story placed in a still image.”
Possibly you share some of these same thoughts, or you may have some other insights to share? I would love to hear how art has been beneficial for you! I do believe art is important to our mental health, and I am pretty passionate about this. It can allow you a time to reflect, process, share, and even express how you are feeling without using any spoken words. Art can provide us with the opportunity to explore and learn from each other.
Art is our first language, it is universal, and all around us. So, what is your art language? Are you a viewer, creator, or both?! Whatever it may be, I hope it brings you peace, allows you an opportunity to take risks, provides enjoyment, and brightens your world when you need it the most.

In order to meet the unique needs of teaching art virtually, my colleagues and I worked diligently to assemble art kits for students to use at home for painting, drawing, jewelry, and even ceramics.
Entering my students’ homes, via google meet sessions, was enlightening. Sometimes students would be babysitting their younger siblings, and they would ask if their siblings could also participate in the lesson. Other times, I would see parents “peek” in to see what was going on virtually and ask questions about materials. Often at the end of each hour, I would have one or two students remaining online wanting to share their work with me, or even just to talk to me.
When we returned to in person classes, the students were different. My classes were quieter, and learning to be in person again was an adjustment. Something else had changed, students became more personal in their artwork. I always had a few students who shared things they observed, or worried about, but this time students were sharing more personal life events. I had students openly, through their artwork, visually describe their feelings about losing a parent, family addictions, trauma, anxiety, and gender issues. The most positive thing about it was students were overall more acceptive and less judgemental of each other. The Art Studio provided a safe place for these people to vent and produce some wonderful artwork.
Think for a moment, what do you enjoy most about art? Do you display it in your home? Do you like to create? Do you like to explore new places and cultures? Do you enjoy being creative through painting, drawing, cooking, gardening, music, theater, writing, photography, etc..? Did you rediscover your creative side during the pandemic? I think many people did rediscover their creative selves during that time at home, even if it included doing some home improvements! People from all walks of life and all ages are taking the time to include art in one way or another into their life. By doing this I believe people are discovering the benefits.
Recently I polled my Instagram followers, and asked the question, why do you enjoy art? Here are a few responses:
“I love how art conveys thoughts, emotions, and feelings that words can’t express. It makes me happy.”; “I love how you can make anything into art, like nature (pics, driftwood, etc..)”; “Art brings me joy. I love being creative and making things.”; “There are no limits. You can express yourself in ways words may not.”; “Creativity”; and “I can create an entire story placed in a still image.”
Possibly you share some of these same thoughts, or you may have some other insights to share? I would love to hear how art has been beneficial for you! I do believe art is important to our mental health, and I am pretty passionate about this. It can allow you a time to reflect, process, share, and even express how you are feeling without using any spoken words. Art can provide us with the opportunity to explore and learn from each other.
Art is our first language, it is universal, and all around us. So, what is your art language? Are you a viewer, creator, or both?! Whatever it may be, I hope it brings you peace, allows you an opportunity to take risks, provides enjoyment, and brightens your world when you need it the most.

An opportunity exists to reintegrate cell phone usage as a class work assignment. Individually or in groups, students can be challenged to use their cell phones to find examples of media they believe to be homogenous – i.e., are ""purely visual or verbal,"" as Mitchell put it. As much media is interdependent as such, students may have a hard time finding examples (at least with online and modern media content) – if they cannot, all the better, point made. However even if this is the case, it can be pointed out that things like dance and interpretive art are areas where it might be argued that the message is purely visual; or Web sites that rely heavily or only on text are areas where it might be argued that the message is solely verbal. Otherwise, much of our art, entertainment and modern media are interdependent on words and pictures enhancing meaning for each.
In order to inspire students to not simply combine media, but to integrate them – using pictures and words symbiotically – strong examples could be used. One such example is the video ""Changing Education Paradigms"" by Sir Ken Robinson on Youtube (Appendix A-7). It is an animated video set to a speech given on the state and future of education. The pictures and animation help enhance understanding of the speech, and students can be solicited to analyze this. Reponses may include: seeing a drawing of what he was talking about made it clearer – things like the ADHD epidemic and how schools are modeled like factories are made clearer by the pictures demonstrating it
The Visual Thesis Statement
The task of writing an effective thesis statement is difficult even in words. Expecting students to not feel frustrated that they also must enhance it with a visual image can be daunting. The goal with the visual thesis statement is to allow for the visual aspect to ease the synthesis of writing an effective thesis statement. If they can express it visually, maybe that can aid them in writing one that is more effective. So, how does one represent visually something like, ""Vincent Van Gogh's mental instability, while unfortunate, contributed to his tendency to paint in ways that moved people, and inspired generations of artists since""? Students might find an image online or create one themselves that is appropriately representative of their thesis statement. It will not be without the help of words, however – the objective is for the two media to work symbiotically to express what each respectively would not be able to alone.
Choosing a subject to research
To assist students in choosing their subject, teachers may review Jonathan Klein's point in his TED Talk on photography that images have the power to effect change. It is possible to widen the berth a bit (to allow for effective student choice in this project) and choose a subject who has effected change through visual art. Much homage is paid to writers who have effected political, cultural, economic or artistic change – and much of this is covered in high school English classes. This is an opportunity for students to mentally and academically incorporate visual artists into that cannon. They may choose an artist or painter or sculptor, a photographer or film-maker or actor, a graphic novelist or designer – who students will decide, through their research, has used their work to affect change in the world. Students will combine words and pictures to present a thesis, research and support, outlining how this person has caused that change.
For the purposes of this curricular unit, students should choose a visual artist who has effected change either culturally, politically, artistically, or in media, such as:
Vincent Van Gogh – artistic, cultural, mental health change

"Art Therapy: What is Art Therapy and What Can Art Therapy Help With?
Art Therapy in Massachusetts
While traditional talk therapy can be a great way to discuss our emotions, thoughts, and behaviors, sometimes we just don’t know how to express what we’re experiencing with words.
Art therapy, also known as “creative psychotherapy” invites us to connect to our thoughts and feelings, and express what we’re experiencing through art. Whether it’s painting with watercolors or sculpting with clay, art therapy can be an extremely freeing way to manage behaviors, process feelings, reduce stress, and increase self-awareness.
Clients might discover the nonverbal messages, symbols, and metaphors found in different art forms, which can ultimately lead to an improved understanding of their feelings and behaviors. If someone you know is experiencing internal stressors, mental health symptoms, or developmental changes, and struggles with traditional talk-therapy, they might benefit from art therapy.
One of our trained mental health professionals at Handel Behavioral Health can help your loved one find safety and control within their environment, and can help them to express their internal struggles through art making.
To learn more about what art therapy is, the benefits and the process of healing through creation at HBH, please read on. We can also be reached at (412) 343-4357.
What is Art Therapy?
“Art therapy is not about being an artist. It’s about the process of making art to facilitate a conversation that fosters healing and growth. We use art to identify and understand patterns that occur in relationships.”
-Shanti Sponder, LMHC and ATR
The American Art Therapy Association defines art therapy as an, “Integrative mental health and human services profession that enriches the lives of individuals, families, and communities through active art-making, creative process, applied psychological theory, and human experience within a psychotherapeutic relationship.”
Facilitated by a professional art therapist at HBH, art therapy can safely and effectively improve cognitive and sensorimotor functions, strengthens self-esteem and self-awareness, improves emotional resilience, social skills, and reduces and resolves conflicts and distress.
Who Benefits From Art Therapy?
The process of creating art to foster self health and wellbeing can help people of all ages and backgrounds.
People who have endured emotional trauma, physical violence, domestic abuse, anxiety, depression, and other psychological disturbances can explore their feelings, reconcile emotional conflicts, develop self-awareness, and improve their social skills through art therapy.
Art therapy can be useful in the following situations:
- Adults experiencing extreme stress
- Children experiencing behavioral or social problems at school or at home
- Children or adults who have experienced a traumatic event
- Children with learning disabilities
- Individuals living with a brain injury
- People experiencing mental health problems
What Can Art Therapy Help With?
“I don’t think there’s a mental health condition that art therapy doesn’t help with. Art provides an outlet for people to express themselves: it depends on how willing the client is to express themselves with art.”
– Shanti Sponder, LMHC and ATR
Specific mental health conditions that art therapy can help treat include:
- Aging-related conditions
- Eating disorders
- Emotional difficulties
- Family or relationship problems
- Medical conditions
- Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
- Substance use disorder
What are the Techniques used in Art Therapy?
Art therapy combines the elements of “talk therapy” with the interpretation of visual images to understand the patient’s subconscious.
Techniques are flexible and patient dependent. Art therapists are trained to understand the role that certain colors, textures, and various media can play in the therapeutic process, and how these tools can reveal one’s thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.
An art therapist working with two patients experiencing the same condition might select two different mediums.
For example, someone struggling with severe anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder might find it difficult to express their feelings with the changing nature of watercolors. Controlled mediums like colored pencils might prove more successful.
For some patients, the sensory experience of painting or drawing with their fingers
can calm their nerves and settle their agitation. Other patients can benefit from gripping the paintbrush or pencil to control their mark on the page.
Techniques used in art therapy can include:
- Scribbling and doodling
- Finger painting
- Working with clay

Clients might discover the nonverbal messages, symbols, and metaphors found in different art forms, which can ultimately lead to an improved understanding of their feelings and behaviors. If someone you know is experiencing internal stressors, mental health symptoms, or developmental changes, and struggles with traditional talk-therapy, they might benefit from art therapy.
One of our trained mental health professionals at Handel Behavioral Health can help your loved one find safety and control within their environment, and can help them to express their internal struggles through art making.

What is Art Therapy?
“Art therapy is not about being an artist. It’s about the process of making art to facilitate a conversation that fosters healing and growth. We use art to identify and understand patterns that occur in relationships.”
-Shanti Sponder, LMHC and ATR
The American Art Therapy Association defines art therapy as an, “Integrative mental health and human services profession that enriches the lives of individuals, families, and communities through active art-making, creative process, applied psychological theory, and human experience within a psychotherapeutic relationship.”
Facilitated by a professional art therapist at HBH, art therapy can safely and effectively improve cognitive and sensorimotor functions, strengthens self-esteem and self-awareness, improves emotional resilience, social skills, and reduces and resolves conflicts and distress.
Who Benefits From Art Therapy?
The process of creating art to foster self health and wellbeing can help people of all ages and backgrounds.
People who have endured emotional trauma, physical violence, domestic abuse, anxiety, depression, and other psychological disturbances can explore their feelings, reconcile emotional conflicts, develop self-awareness, and improve their social skills through art therapy.
Art therapy can be useful in the following situations:
- Adults experiencing extreme stress
- Children experiencing behavioral or social problems at school or at home
- Children or adults who have experienced a traumatic event
- Children with learning disabilities
- Individuals living with a brain injury
- People experiencing mental health problems
What Can Art Therapy Help With?
“I don’t think there’s a mental health condition that art therapy doesn’t help with. Art provides an outlet for people to express themselves: it depends on how willing the client is to express themselves with art.”
– Shanti Sponder, LMHC and ATR
Specific mental health conditions that art therapy can help treat include:
- Aging-related conditions
- Eating disorders
- Emotional difficulties
- Family or relationship problems
- Medical conditions

What are the Techniques used in Art Therapy?
Art therapy combines the elements of “talk therapy” with the interpretation of visual images to understand the patient’s subconscious.
Techniques are flexible and patient dependent. Art therapists are trained to understand the role that certain colors, textures, and various media can play in the therapeutic process, and how these tools can reveal one’s thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.
An art therapist working with two patients experiencing the same condition might select two different mediums.
For example, someone struggling with severe anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder might find it difficult to express their feelings with the changing nature of watercolors. Controlled mediums like colored pencils might prove more successful.
For some patients, the sensory experience of painting or drawing with their fingers
can calm their nerves and settle their agitation. Other patients can benefit from gripping the paintbrush or pencil to control their mark on the page.
Techniques used in art therapy can include:
- Scribbling and doodling
- Finger painting

"People protest against injustice in all kinds of ways – through marching, writing, composing songs, downing tools, and occasionally even through threats of violence. Art can be a powerful voice of protest against a political system, and a way of influencing people’s thoughts and opinions.
Art has sometimes been described as a “mirror which reflects society back to itself”, and artists who feel strongly enough will confront society with its injustices, through their images. In the 1960s
and 1970s in South Africa, many artists were persecuted by the apartheid government for creating images that drew attention to the injustices of that oppressive system. Some artists and photographers faced charges in court – and in some cases served jail terms – because they made images that challenged those in authority. Many works of art, literature and music were officially censored or banned during that time.
In 1979, at a conference of artists and art historians called “State of the Art” in Cape Town, a resolution was proposed that art-making be consciously used towards bringing about political change. It was around that time that “resistance art” became the term artists used to talk about their practice in the fight against apartheid.

"Sculpture, a form of art that dates back thousands of years, has undergone a fascinating evolution from classical to contemporary styles. Throughout different eras and cultures, sculptors have shaped and molded various materials to create beautiful three-dimensional artworks that reflect the aesthetics, values, and ideologies of their time.
Classical sculpture, which emerged in ancient Greece around the 5th century BCE, set the foundation for Western sculpture for centuries to come. Inspired by the human body, classical sculptures emphasized idealized proportions and realistic anatomical details. Artists like Phidias and Praxiteles created breathtaking marble sculptures of gods, goddesses, and heroes, capturing an idealized beauty that became the pinnacle of artistic achievement.
During the Renaissance, the classical influence persisted but underwent a transformative change. Artists such as Michelangelo and Donatello infused their sculptures with a newfound realism and emotional depth. Their iconic works, like Michelangelo’s David and Donatello’s David, demonstrated a mastery of human anatomy and portrayed intense psychological expressions, sparking a renewed interest in portraying the individuality and humanity of their subjects.
The Baroque period brought forth a more dramatic and theatrical style of sculpture. Sculptors like Gian Lorenzo Bernini and Peter Paul Rubens used dynamic poses, exaggerated gestures, and intricate details to create powerful and emotionally charged sculptures. The Baroque sculptures were often created to enhance grand architectural projects, depicting religious figures and telling vivid stories with their intricate compositions.
As the world transitioned into the neoclassical era, artists sought to revive the aesthetic principles of ancient Greece and Rome. Sculptors such as Antonio Canova and Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux merged classical ideals with a fresh sensibility, focusing on harmonious proportions, graceful movements, and delicate expressions. These neoclassical sculptures reflected the intellectual and political climate of the time, as they often commemorated heroes and exemplified the values of the Enlightenment.
With the arrival of the 20th century, sculpture ventured into new territories, embracing modernism and beyond. Artists like Auguste Rodin and Constantin Brâncuși shattered the boundaries of traditional representation, experimenting with abstract forms and fragmented figures. Rodin’s The Kiss and Brâncuși’s Bird in Space challenged the idea of capturing physical likeness and introduced a subjective interpretation of reality, emphasizing emotional and conceptual aspects.
Contemporary sculpture continues to push the boundaries of artistic expression. Artists today work with a broad range of materials, from traditional mediums like bronze and stone to unconventional materials like glass, paper, and even found objects. Installation art, a form of sculpture that involves transforming the space itself, has gained prominence. Names like Louise Bourgeois, Antony Gormley, and Jeff Koons have become synonymous with pushing the limits of sculptural innovation.
The evolution of sculpture from classical to contemporary is a testament to the ever-changing nature of human creativity. Throughout history, sculptors have continuously challenged themselves to redefine the boundaries of what is possible, constantly pushing the limits of their craft. And as we look to the future, we can expect sculpture to continue to evolve, adapt, and surprise us with new forms of artistic expression that capture the ever-changing spirit of our times.","How did the emphasis on dynamism and speed in modern art movements, such as Futurism, influence the development of urban architecture and city planning during the early 20th century?"

"Conceptual art blog is a movement in contemporary art that pushes the boundaries of traditional artistic practices. It emerged in the mid-20th century and challenges the notion of physical aesthetics, emphasizing the importance of ideas and concepts behind the artwork.
The Essence of Conceptual Art
At its core, conceptual art prioritizes the idea or concept behind the artwork rather than the visual aesthetics. This approach allows artists to focus on thought-provoking and intellectually stimulating pieces that may not conform to conventional beauty.
Exploring Unconventional Materials
Conceptual artists often utilize uncommon or unconventional materials to create their artworks. This choice emphasizes the intention behind the piece rather than its visual appeal. For example, using found objects, ready-mades, or even intangible elements like sound or light, artists challenge the traditional notion of what constitutes art.
The Power of Context
The context in which a conceptual artwork is presented plays a vital role in its interpretation. Unlike traditional art forms, where the artwork stands alone, conceptual art often requires additional information or documentation to fully grasp the artist’s intentions. This inclusion of contextual elements transforms the viewer’s experience into an active participation.
Questioning the Boundaries
“Can’t the artist simply think about an artwork without physically creating it?”
This question lies at the heart of conceptual art. By calling into question the conventional methods of artistic production and questioning the boundaries of what can be considered art, conceptual artists challenge the very essence of creativity and artistic expression. The focus shifts from the final product to the thought process behind it.
Exploring Socio-Political Ideas
Many conceptual artworks delve into socio-political ideas by addressing important issues or challenging dominant narratives. By utilizing symbolic elements, metaphorical gestures, or thought-provoking imagery, artists aim to provoke critical thinking and initiate conversations on various topics.
The Role of the Viewer
Conceptual art places significant emphasis on the role of the viewer. By shifting the focus from traditional aesthetics to intellectual engagement, the viewer becomes an active participant in the interpretation of the artwork. The artist’s intention acts as a catalyst for the viewer’s own thoughts, experiences, and perspectives, fostering a unique and personal connection to the piece.
The Boundaries of Creation
Breaking free from the confines of traditional art-making, conceptual artists explore new realms of creative possibilities. They challenge established norms, redefine artistic processes, and encourage a broader understanding of what art can be. In doing so, they expand the boundaries of creativity itself.
The world of conceptual art blog invites viewers to step into a realm where ideas, concepts, and intellectual exploration take center stage.

"Fire on the Ganges is an insightful yet compassionate book that hits hard with its bare facts by examination of the systemic gaps within a highly stratified society that systematically marginalises the specific community of the Doms, depriving them of even the basic remnants of humanity.
There is a striking difference between Hindu religious paintings and sculptures and Renaissance art in how mythological images are portrayed. In Hindu imagery, there is a strong emphasis on ornate decorations, starting from goldthreaded silk attires to jewellery with elaborate designs, garlands around the neck, and massive tiaras or other headgear.
These are common features, whether these figures are worshipped as idols in temples or displayed in the form of paintings on walls.
Even the background vistas are filled with colourful items like hills, rivers, abundant floral arrangements, leafy trees, roaming peacocks, and deer.
One would be hardpressed to just see the faces of mythological figures. They all have beautiful but expressionless faces with similar large dark eyes with long eyelashes, rosy cheeks, bright red lips, and a third eye on the forehead for some. I could never tell looking at an idol of Maa Durga if she was angry, happy, or proud of her triumph over Mahishasura; she always seems to be in a half-meditative state, ready to bless all her disciples.
Exposed parts of the bodies of even the males give one the impression of a young, plump figure with smooth joints, soft skin, and round faces.
The Greco-Roman art of the Renaissance era, on the other hand, depicts human figures in their natural forms with very little dressing up, whether they are painted or sculpted. Most of the figures are scantily dressed, if not completely nude, displaying the muscular bodies of the males and delicately beautiful curvy female figures.
They inspire not just religious fervour but a creative urge to replicate them in some way.
A conclusion about the connection between art and God becomes inescapable. The images also personify the characters in mythology so that one can almost identify with their emotions.
The only Hindu goddess appearing naked is Mother Kali, but she is depicted covering most of her body with heads and arms she chopped off in her raging act of decimating the demons. She invokes a feeling of fear, not artistic inspiration.
The recent trend in Durga puja pandals in Kolkata has been to present the idols of Maa Durga and her children in a non-traditional fashion. In any given pandal, images of all the figures are constructed in a unique way and follow a certain theme. The theme can be Egyptian art, Mayan art, space robots, ancient statues, medical concepts (portraying coronavirus as a demon, for example), military conflicts, recent political events, and many others.
Sree Bhumi Sporting Club has gone one step further. They not only changed the presentation of idols; they also changed the appearance of the entire puja pandal to give it an international flavour.
In 2021, they designed the pandal as a 145-foot-tall scaled-down replica of Burj Khalifa, the world’s tallest building in Dubai. In 2022, the pandal was designed in the form of St. Peter’s Cathedral in the Vatican.
As a result, visiting the puja pandals has become an exercise in appreciation of art and architecture in addition to a religious celebration.
The presentation of pandals in the form of Islamic or Christian landmarks at a major Hindu festival also adds a secular feel to the event. While this trend has become immensely popular, it overemphasises the creativity of the artist and novelty of the concept, not the deities themselves, who should be the centre of our attention.
No one, neither the potter nor the priest nor the visitors, seems to pay any attention to the emotional display of the deities. By contrast, when I visited Italy for the first time, I was awed by how the mythological figures were drawn or sculpted by the Renaissance artists of Rome and Florence, who not only displayed their physiques but also their emotional states. My idol is Michelangelo. His two statues, “Pieta ” in Saint Peter’s Cathedral in Rome and “David” in Florence, are probably the two most beautiful statues in the world.
I can almost feel the pain of Mother Mary when I look at Pieta. David is the perfect male figure, majestically and nonchalantly standing seventeen feet tall, completely naked, and contemplating his next move against Goliath.
Michelangelo’s paintings of the Sistine Chapel remain unparalleled even to this day in terms of the enormity of the displays; they reflect all the emotions of dozens of human beings, including grief, terror, joy, pain, etc., as well as the details of their physical appearances.
I have often fantasised about what would have happened if Michelangelo were commissioned to paint or sculpt figures presenting stories from Hindu mythological tales on the walls and ceilings of famous temples in India.","How do the organizers of a popular cultural festival, known for its extravagant displays, balance the financial burden of staging the event with the need to maintain its artistic integrity and community involvement?"
"Fire on the Ganges is an insightful yet compassionate book that hits hard with its bare facts by examination of the systemic gaps within a highly stratified society that systematically marginalises the specific community of the Doms, depriving them of even the basic remnants of humanity.
There is a striking difference between Hindu religious paintings and sculptures and Renaissance art in how mythological images are portrayed. In Hindu imagery, there is a strong emphasis on ornate decorations, starting from goldthreaded silk attires to jewellery with elaborate designs, garlands around the neck, and massive tiaras or other headgear.
These are common features, whether these figures are worshipped as idols in temples or displayed in the form of paintings on walls.

"Museums are created to show art, but they are also an invaluable place to hold conversations where critical thinking takes place on subjects such as current affairs, tolerance, gender equality, creative thinking, politics, human rights and more. Every day of our lives, we come into contact with seemingly innocuous images that are in fact ideologically driven. Adverts in the Underground or on TV, photos in the press and Hollywood movies all transmit ideas about issues such as gender, class, nationality and ethnicity. It is very easy to remain oblivious to the effects these can have on society, as such images from the media and popular culture tend to be consumed in a state of distraction. A visit to a gallery can be a similar experience for the untrained eye. The gallery bombards us with so many images that it can be hard to take in anything at all, let alone to look at the works from a critical standpoint.
Our contemporary visual culture, from ads to films, is highly influenced by the canon of art history and, through this, the predominant ‘gaze’ of Western patriarchy and its ways of representing the world. Yes, art from the past can be beautiful, but it is also telling us some often quite uncomfortable things. There is a lot to be gained from examining pictures in galleries to see how they can be relevant to issues in contemporary society, as well as to our own personal experiences. Our workshops concentrate on visual literacy: learning how to look at and ‘read’ artworks and, by extension, all manner of images that we see day to day. Aiming to escape a passive reception and acceptance of art, we promote the act of looking as an active, critical dialogue.
We will highlight some well-known and lesser-known paintings and provide a platform for dialogue on the gender-related issues that they bring to light – from beauty contests to war violence to motherhood.
We will develop and put into practice our visual literacy, and will walk away looking at the images that surround us every day – from blockbuster movies to adverts on the tube – in a very different way!
We welcome everyone, irrespective of gender, age, background…
We can’t wait to hear your perspectives and re-think the history of art with you!

We will discover the rarely-discussed, yet fundamental role of ceramics in British society and we will discuss its role in our own lives as women and, above all, as individuals.","Can you analyze the ways in which a particular advertisement for a beauty product reinforces or challenges dominant beauty standards, and how this relates to the broader cultural and ideological context in which it was created?"

Deep self-examination is the first step in defining our big project.
Lets start with first considering the conscious/unconscious cultural beliefs we hold about creativity, the art making process, and the artist herself - which are not true and do not serve a thriving artist mindset.
Some examples are:
It is important to keep an awareness of these notions so that we can replace them with a new set of accurate beliefs that support the creative process and provide a foundation for our growth and success.
Some examples of a thriving artist mindset include:
With our new thriving artist mindset in place, we can conduct a deep self-examination by brainstorming through a process called mind mapping. Mind maps are a great way to get clear about yourself, providing self-reflection and ultimately help us define a project idea that is important to you. Knowing yourself will make your work personal and distinctive. This mind map exercise will help you find your “voice.”
To create your mind map you will need:
This is a rapid process without any editing. The more immediate the better.Let’s Begin:
Start by writing your name in the center of the page. Next, write associated words to branch off from your name. Include topics such as, “Things I like”, “Background”, “Ideas”, “Strengths”, “Weaknesses”, “Inspirations”, etc.. Continue to branch off from each of those words with any associations that come to mind and continue this process as far as you can. I ran out of room on my drawing page as you can see below, so this is where I stopped.
Here is an example of my Mind Map.
Once you have finished your mind map set it aside for awhile and come back to it later. When you come back to it, take a significant amount of time to analyze it. Make additional connections or add notes. Draw new connecting lines to reveal new associations. Take notice of patterns, repetitions, connections, and cycles that may be present. You can repeat the mind map process based on sub-nodes to explore further.
After completing this process, create a text outline from your mind map. This will help you analyze and clearly see he hierarchy of your map. It is also a legible way to share your thoughts and ideas with others.
Here is an example of my Mind Map Text Outline.
You should now be able to identify topics, interests, and ideas that are meaningful to you.
I would like to point out that one of the topics that came out of my Mind Map under “My Challenges” was “Fears” such as “I’m too old”, I’m not good enough,” etc... The list goes on and on.I just want to remind everyone that fear is a common and normal response to the unknown and we all have fears.
David Bayles and Ted Orland, working artists and co-authors of the book, “Art and Fear” comment on fear and making art.
“ Making art is dangerous and revealing. Making art precipitates self-doubt, stirring deep waters that lay between what you know you should be, and what you fear you might be.”
They continue to explain that...
“art is a high calling - fears are coincidental, sneaky and disruptive, ...disguising themselves laziness, resistance to deadlines, irritation with materials and surroundings, distractions over the achievements of others.”
Each step in the creative process puts those fears to the test.
Always challenge your fears.

Art Lover's VIP’s Newsleter","What are some common creative pitfalls that artists often fall into when they don't take the time to understand their personal weaknesses, and how can self-reflection and mind mapping help them avoid these pitfalls?"
"Young-Hae Chang Heavy Industries, for instance, explores the interactions between music and literature and provides a medium through which we can appreciate the interplay between the two forms of art, thus augmenting the individual interpretations into something more complex. Young-Hae Chang Heavy Industries pair their jazz pieces with a movie-like stream of words and phrases of varying sizes, speeds, and colors. Though the words do not form complete sentences, they are associated in a way that they flow with the music; rhythmically creating a disjointed stream of consciousness that comes together to tell a story. It is together the display, music and the words themselves that are telling the story, and thus how the story unfolds depends on the interpretation of the receiver, and how they associate the visual, sonic, and textual components. Thus, the result will be slightly different for everyone, and may even be different for a single person each time they listen. The patterns, colors, sizes, timing, and orientation of how the words appear on the screen in addition to the blinking and changing backgrounds augment the way that the meaning behind the text is associated along with the changing beats and notes of the music. These two artistic components are intertwined to establish an ultimate experience that changes that way we interpret both, interplaying off each other to affect the way each is perceived in relation to the other. Words can invoke feeling just as music can, and that feeling can affect how you interpret the music, or vice versa. Certain words may stand out to you, whether it is because of how they were oriented on the screen or the timing from which they appeared in relation to the music, whether it had gotten quieter or louder, faster or slower. This specific kind of experience differs for each person—different things stand out to different people and thus have different significance to different people. Subsequently, each person will have a different interpretation of the piece, and thus the story. These components can even establish a mood, and thus they are not only augmenting the perception of the work itself, but also the environment through which the receiver extracts such interpretations. The simultaneous interpretations determined from listening to the music, viewing the colors and timing of the words, and reading the text affect each other, thus the overall experience differs from the individual experience of each of these elements. This can be observed by muting the sound for one of the pieces. The words and their motions along still portray the story; yet do not produce impact on the reader. The music helps guide the reader through the text, providing pace and extracting emotions that the words along cannot. This process works in the reverse as well; listening to the music alone without the words deprives the sound of any particular meaning. It is the pairing of these two components that augments the way we perceive the literature as a whole. This concept can be experienced in their piece “Lotus Blossom”.
The Young-Hae Chang Heavy Industries project adds an artistic element to written work that serves to enhance it and provide a means through which we can expand the boundaries of both music and literature to heighten the potential of both media and increase our levels of interaction and interpretation. The combination of reading and listening skills allows our interpretations to interplay with each other, forming an augmented version of a musical piece and a work of literature. Literature should not be bound by the confines of print, but rather should reach out to other medias to build on what the print has given us; to work together to build upon our knowledge and heighten our intellectual stimulation and explore the full potentials of the data presented by written word.","Can the use of colors and patterns in digital art be used to create a sense of unease or discomfort in a literary work, and if so, how might this affect the reader's emotional response to the work?"

This can be observed by muting the sound for one of the pieces. The words and their motions along still portray the story; yet do not produce impact on the reader. The music helps guide the reader through the text, providing pace and extracting emotions that the words along cannot. This process works in the reverse as well; listening to the music alone without the words deprives the sound of any particular meaning. It is the pairing of these two components that augments the way we perceive the literature as a whole. This concept can be experienced in their piece “Lotus Blossom”.
The Young-Hae Chang Heavy Industries project adds an artistic element to written work that serves to enhance it and provide a means through which we can expand the boundaries of both music and literature to heighten the potential of both media and increase our levels of interaction and interpretation. The combination of reading and listening skills allows our interpretations to interplay with each other, forming an augmented version of a musical piece and a work of literature. Literature should not be bound by the confines of print, but rather should reach out to other medias to build on what the print has given us; to work together to build upon our knowledge and heighten our intellectual stimulation and explore the full potentials of the data presented by written word.","Can the emotional impact of a multimedia piece be enhanced by incorporating subtle audio cues that are not synchronized with the visual or textual components, but rather respond to the viewer's emotional state as tracked by a wearable device?"

This week, we worked on the use of line and watercolor techniques as we continued to explore ideas of portraits as a way to capture the likeness of others - well, actually maybe the opposite of that. Using blind contour and bilateral drawings, students used their observation skills to draw, but most definitely ended up with very abstract outcomes. We used this opportunity to discuss that as artists, we have the option of how we want to portray our subject. Sometimes it calls for more realism and sometimes it needs to be more abstract or expressive.
It was a fun process to take students through and I will be interested to see if any of them end up applying it to their final works as we get moving on our ""You, Me, Everybody"" themed projects.
Clay in STEAM Class
In this class, students have a ""Have to"" and ""Can do"" project for each of the letters in STEAM. This means that there is one teacher-directed project and one student-direct project within Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Mathematics.
For our first set of projects that are Science-based, students had to work with clay and create a piece that could play music/sound. The design of the ceramic works were based on endangered species.
In addition to this, students also had the opportunity to hear from two of our high school ceramic students as they visited and demonstrated their abilities on the wheel. It was awesome for students to hear how they work with the clay to create their works and in doing so, explain the chemistry of the clay and the physics of throwing and manipulating forms on the wheel.
This opportunity to have skills students present to our younger students is something that I hope to do more of in the future. I was very proud of all of the students who asked questions and the way those questions were answered.

Sculptural art began in the Upper Paleolithic with a small figure known as the Löwenmensch. It is considered to be over 40,000 years old. Sculpture can be made with most 3D modular materials.

Sculpture is an artistic activity in which the artist produces shapes in volume. Metal sculpture obviously involves using metal as the final rendering material. The interest of metal lies in its malleability.

"Activity One: Pictures in Learning, Pictures in Life
Students should be inspired to think in a different way about the images they see every day, as well as the use of their cell phones. By beginning the unit with ""Everyone – please take out your cell phones,"" students might be pleasantly confused as to who you are, let alone what will happen next. Once cell phones are out (or students without the use of such devices are on computers), they should retrieve an old or search for a new picture that means something to them. It must be appropriate for class, and can be of anything – family, a fun event, or even a celebrity or movie-still. What does this image mean to them? After they write a brief journal response, they could be asked: What do you think this image might communicate to others?
Every image is meaningful – some are socially significant. Students may respond to what ""socially significant"" might mean. Answers may include – it means something to most people; it is relatable on a mass scale; it encompasses a theme or pathos that is universal.
Plato's Cave and cave drawings
""Plato's Cave"" is a thought experiment that can be utilized for a wonderful activity surrounding the use of images to communicate a message. The thought activity surrounds a concept of a cave full of beings, bound and forced to look in one direction, communicating with each other about images they see displayed on a wall in front of them. The animalistic images are projected on the wall by ""masters"" holding puppets up to a fire. The reader must decide if the bound residents of the cave are forced to interpret themselves as the beings projected on the wall, as this is all they have ever known, so the voices they hear of each other and the masters can only be interpreted as those of the shadows on the wall (Appendix A-1). Students may work individually or in groups to draw an interpretation of what they've read – what the cave looks like, leading to a class discussion on the significance of images.
This provides a segue into talking about the difference between that ""cave"" and the cave early man lived in (cave drawings/prehistoric art). The Lascaux cave drawings are very early socially significant images. In order to discuss the origin of language and whether images coincided with that, students could be prompted: Is anyone familiar with this work (Appendix A-2)?
Cave painting of a horse found in the Lascaux Caves in France – estimated to have been created during the Paleolithic era. Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Lascaux2.jpg
Following a class discussion on this drawing from the Lascaux Caves, students could ask: What makes this socially significant? Answers can include: whoever drew it knew what a horse looked like; a horse must have been a common thing back then if it was drawn like this; everyone knows what a horse looks like.
How we interpret images speaks to how we interpret the world. According to Susan Sontag, ""photographed images do not seem to be statements about the world so much as pieces of it, miniatures of reality that anyone can make or acquire.""
Therefore, the significance of the image as a means of communication is paramount. Images are a part of language, and both factor into perception.
Perception, with David M. Eagleman and Susan Sontag
Working with several creative images that contain optical illusions, students may be challenged to consider on what exactly is their view of reality based. They will begin with an exercise incorporating said images in the form of handouts. Many fun examples of optical illusions can be found online (Appendix A-3). For these purposes, we will use a blind spot text outlined in
by David M. Eagleman – wherein the subject closes one eye while looking at a picture of a plus sign and a circle, and brings the picture closer to their face. At a certain point, the circle disappears into our ""blind spot."" (Appendix A-3) Regarding this clear gap in our field of vision, Eagleman argues that ""You're not perceiving what's out there. You're perceiving whatever your brain tells you.""
With these kinds of holes in our vision, how can we assume that anything we perceive is real? Student responses may include: We have formed a common agreement on consistencies in what we see; we all agree that a plus sign looks like what we just stared at to find our blind spot; since prehistoric times, our view of a horse is roughly that of the drawing in the Lascaux Caves. We like to have our reality ""confirmed"" as Sontag puts it, an experience that is ""enhanced by photographs.""",Can a society that relies heavily on oral tradition rather than written language develop a unique perspective on the concept of reality?

Plato's Cave and cave drawings
""Plato's Cave"" is a thought experiment that can be utilized for a wonderful activity surrounding the use of images to communicate a message. The thought activity surrounds a concept of a cave full of beings, bound and forced to look in one direction, communicating with each other about images they see displayed on a wall in front of them. The animalistic images are projected on the wall by ""masters"" holding puppets up to a fire. The reader must decide if the bound residents of the cave are forced to interpret themselves as the beings projected on the wall, as this is all they have ever known, so the voices they hear of each other and the masters can only be interpreted as those of the shadows on the wall (Appendix A-1). Students may work individually or in groups to draw an interpretation of what they've read – what the cave looks like, leading to a class discussion on the significance of images.
This provides a segue into talking about the difference between that ""cave"" and the cave early man lived in (cave drawings/prehistoric art). The Lascaux cave drawings are very early socially significant images. In order to discuss the origin of language and whether images coincided with that, students could be prompted: Is anyone familiar with this work (Appendix A-2)?

"This project was quite extensive, but one of my favorite projects I have ever taught! We spent a day having a class discussion about the work of Shepard Fairey and the way Shepard Fairey uses visual art as a way to draw attention to a particular social issue such as pollution, inequality, and greed. We also talked about the works of Banksy and Ricardo Levins Morales (Minneapolis-based activist artist). We listened to a Podcast interview of Ricardo and his work. Listen to the podcast of Ricardo Levins Morales on MPR here.
Students were first asked to brainstorm different social issues. At first, some students really struggled thinking of ideas. For the kids who struggled, I asked them what they liked. For example, a student said he liked music. I asked him if he knew of any problems in the music industry. He immediately said ""Piracy"", ""Inequality"", ""Sexism"" and ""People need to support local music more"". These are all great examples of social issues that tie into a student interest. Some examples of social issues chosen by students for this project include marriage equality, racial equality, saving and protecting animals, recycling, protecting the environment, religious equality, self esteem, perfectionism, anti-bullying, and greed.
One issue I did run into was I had one student who wanted to do a design based around legalizing marijuana. Even though I personally didn't find this offensive, I knew it would be an issue since I teach at a public school! Drugs are bad...mmmk? So I had to explain to the student that while I am all for freedom of expression, that I would appreciate it if he chose a different, more school appropriate topic. I dislike the idea of censorship in my classroom, but there's got to be a line drawn somewhere, right?
Next, students were given the challenge of illustrating that social issue. The goal was to create a design that clearly illustrated the chosen social issue. Some students did better at this than others. Each student had to show me their design plan in order to get their linoleum. Students used a 6B ebony pencil to outline their design plan, flip the plan on top of the linoleum, and burnish the design onto the linoleum. This helped students keep their words & letters backwards when carving without having to worry about writing the letters and words backwards.
Finally, students started carving their designs! View my demo video below for complete instructions.
Students were asked to create 6 different prints and choose 3 for display. After they finished preparing their prints for exhibit, they were asked to write an artist statement.

"The images made by the plant oils are a collaboration between my human consciousness and plant consciousness. I make a series of decisions prior to pouring the plant oils which influence the process. I prepare the canvas, I select the pigments and plants oils, I choose the location on the floor for the pour, and I pick the time of day or night to do it. All these decisions influence the flow of paint. However, the materials are so volatile and sensitive—so alive that it is impossible for me to control how the painting will turn out. In fact, the paintings almost never turn out the way I think they might. Unlike Jackson Pollock, the abstract expressionist painter known best for his “drip” paintings, who proclaimed, “I can control the flow of paint: there is no accident,” 6 I make no such claims. Once I pour the plant oils into the pigments, it takes every effort to restrain myself and just watch. I cannot try to influence the oil’s movement; my interference ruins the process. I am reminded of a line from Sol Le Witt’s Sentences on Conceptual Art, “if the artist changes his mind midway through the execution of the pieces, he compromises the result… the artist’s will is secondary to the process he initiates from the idea to the completion.”7 Not only can I not control how the paint will flow, I cannot control whether the painting will become a work of art or not. Not all paintings do. The ones that do have a life of their own. I am part of the process. The paintings that don’t become works of art are still part of the process. Each painting is an experience that forms my consciousness. Each pour becomes part of the next painting sort of like how every day lived becomes part of the next day.
The process is like life; we make plans but we cannot control how they will turn out. We cannot see the future. Living requires us to trust and to take risks, like making a painting, or falling in love. As I watch the plant oils make their own image, I am mesmerized, transfixed. I wonder does my consciousness affect the process? That deepest of mysteries: does thought influence matter? As I watch, I am to such an extent one with the process, I become part of it. However much I want and desire each painting to be a work of art, I cannot will it to be so. I can only be part of the process, part of mystery.
What brings the work of art into being may be like the insemination. Not every act of sexual intercourse will lead to a new life. The word insemination come from the Latin literally meaning to cast a seed. Plucking the daisy apart petal by petal, the flower is dismembered but its seeds are spread. Some seeds will take root and with the help of the sun grow to become new daisies. This is the creative process, and as Joseph Beuys, another artist who conversed with matter once said, “everyone is an artist.” 8 I would agree and add that everyone is a channel, and all our channels to the sun together make consciousness, which we are all apart of.
The daisy oracle dates to medieval folklore but survives as a modern myth too. In 1892 Harry Dacre wrote a song about falling in love with a daisy called Daisy Bell. In his composition Dacre used the dialogic structure of the daisy oracle asking, Daisy, Daisy give me your answer do. The Daisy in Dacre’s song is personified into a woman. No longer a plant, Daisy has become a flower in his heart. There was allegedly a real woman who inspired Daisy Bell, her name was Frances Evelyn Greville, the Countess of Warwick, who went by the nickname of Daisy. This accounts for the Daisy in the name but where did Dacre get Bell? Possibly because the Latin name for the daisy is Bellis Perennis. Or maybe because of all the words in the song that rhyme with bell: tell, well, belle.
The word belle means beautiful woman and would seem to be the more logical choice for a love song, but Dacre’s song is not a typical love song, woven into its lyrics are a love that is spiritual as well as romantic. Dacre immigrated to America from England in 1891 with his bicycle. Upon arrival he was asked to pay a customs tax on his bike. His friend tried to console him on this unexpected expense by saying it could have been worse—at least his bicycle was not a tandem which would have cost him twice as much– finding humor in the relentless logic of capitalism. This quip became the song’s central metaphor: a bicycle built for two. Bicycles at the end of the 19th century were more affordable than cars, and thus available to the working class. The bicycle represented a new mobility and freedom to all the classes, rich and poor, and the tandem bicycle additionally represented new possibilities for partnership between the sexes.

"The images made by the plant oils are a collaboration between my human consciousness and plant consciousness. I make a series of decisions prior to pouring the plant oils which influence the process. I prepare the canvas, I select the pigments and plants oils, I choose the location on the floor for the pour, and I pick the time of day or night to do it. All these decisions influence the flow of paint. However, the materials are so volatile and sensitive—so alive that it is impossible for me to control how the painting will turn out. In fact, the paintings almost never turn out the way I think they might. Unlike Jackson Pollock, the abstract expressionist painter known best for his “drip” paintings, who proclaimed, “I can control the flow of paint: there is no accident,” 6 I make no such claims. Once I pour the plant oils into the pigments, it takes every effort to restrain myself and just watch. I cannot try to influence the oil’s movement; my interference ruins the process. I am reminded of a line from Sol Le Witt’s Sentences on Conceptual Art, “if the artist changes his mind midway through the execution of the pieces, he compromises the result… the artist’s will is secondary to the process he initiates from the idea to the completion.”7 Not only can I not control how the paint will flow, I cannot control whether the painting will become a work of art or not. Not all paintings do. The ones that do have a life of their own. I am part of the process. The paintings that don’t become works of art are still part of the process. Each painting is an experience that forms my consciousness. Each pour becomes part of the next painting sort of like how every day lived becomes part of the next day.
The process is like life; we make plans but we cannot control how they will turn out. We cannot see the future. Living requires us to trust and to take risks, like making a painting, or falling in love. As I watch the plant oils make their own image, I am mesmerized, transfixed. I wonder does my consciousness affect the process? That deepest of mysteries: does thought influence matter? As I watch, I am to such an extent one with the process, I become part of it. However much I want and desire each painting to be a work of art, I cannot will it to be so. I can only be part of the process, part of mystery.
What brings the work of art into being may be like the insemination. Not every act of sexual intercourse will lead to a new life. The word insemination come from the Latin literally meaning to cast a seed. Plucking the daisy apart petal by petal, the flower is dismembered but its seeds are spread. Some seeds will take root and with the help of the sun grow to become new daisies. This is the creative process, and as Joseph Beuys, another artist who conversed with matter once said, “everyone is an artist.” 8 I would agree and add that everyone is a channel, and all our channels to the sun together make consciousness, which we are all apart of.
The daisy oracle dates to medieval folklore but survives as a modern myth too. In 1892 Harry Dacre wrote a song about falling in love with a daisy called Daisy Bell. In his composition Dacre used the dialogic structure of the daisy oracle asking, Daisy, Daisy give me your answer do. The Daisy in Dacre’s song is personified into a woman. No longer a plant, Daisy has become a flower in his heart. There was allegedly a real woman who inspired Daisy Bell, her name was Frances Evelyn Greville, the Countess of Warwick, who went by the nickname of Daisy. This accounts for the Daisy in the name but where did Dacre get Bell? Possibly because the Latin name for the daisy is Bellis Perennis. Or maybe because of all the words in the song that rhyme with bell: tell, well, belle.
The word belle means beautiful woman and would seem to be the more logical choice for a love song, but Dacre’s song is not a typical love song, woven into its lyrics are a love that is spiritual as well as romantic. Dacre immigrated to America from England in 1891 with his bicycle. Upon arrival he was asked to pay a customs tax on his bike. His friend tried to console him on this unexpected expense by saying it could have been worse—at least his bicycle was not a tandem which would have cost him twice as much– finding humor in the relentless logic of capitalism. This quip became the song’s central metaphor: a bicycle built for two. Bicycles at the end of the 19th century were more affordable than cars, and thus available to the working class. The bicycle represented a new mobility and freedom to all the classes, rich and poor, and the tandem bicycle additionally represented new possibilities for partnership between the sexes. In photos from the period, the female is typically in the lead position and the man in the rear.

"Crafting for Wellness: How Engaging in Artistic Hobbies Can Benefit Your Mental Health
In today’s fast-paced and stressful world, finding ways to prioritize mental health has become increasingly important. As individuals seek ways to reduce stress and enhance overall well-being, the practice of engaging in artistic hobbies, often referred to as crafting, has gained popularity due to its positive impact on mental health. Crafting offers a creative outlet that can significantly benefit one’s emotional and psychological well-being.
Artistic expression and creativity have long been recognized as powerful therapeutic tools. Engaging in crafts such as knitting, painting, pottery, or any other artistic hobby allows individuals to enter a state of flow, where they become completely absorbed in their activity. This state of flow, often described as being “in the zone,” enables individuals to calm their minds, reduce anxiety, and escape from the stresses of daily life.
Crafting also provides an avenue for mindfulness, promoting a state of present-moment awareness and increased mental clarity. Focusing on a creative task helps redirect attention away from negative thoughts or worries, allowing individuals to find solace in the moment and engage in a restorative activity. This redirection of attention can be particularly beneficial for individuals with anxiety or depression, as it offers a temporary respite from their symptoms.
Furthermore, the process of creating something beautiful or unique can boost self-esteem and self-worth. Finishing a handmade creation gives individuals a sense of accomplishment and pride in their abilities. This feeling of achievement contributes positively to one’s overall mood and self-perception, enabling a more positive mindset and increased mental resilience.
Crafting also fosters social connections and a sense of community, which plays a fundamental role in mental well-being. Joining craft clubs, attending workshops, or simply sharing one’s creations online can lead to meaningful connections with like-minded individuals. Engaging in conversations about shared interests and exchanging tips and ideas can create a support network that promotes overall satisfaction and a sense of belonging.
Moreover, pursuing artistic hobbies allows for personal expression and emotional exploration, even when words fail. Art has the power to communicate emotions that might otherwise be difficult to express, offering a safe and non-judgmental space for self-reflection. Engaging with color, texture, and various mediums allows individuals to tap into their own unique experiences, channel emotions, and find catharsis.
Crafting can also serve as a healthy coping mechanism for stress management. Engaging in a creative activity during times of stress can be a healthy outlet for emotional release, preventing feelings from building up and potentially leading to negative mental health outcomes. By redirecting focus towards a task that brings joy and satisfaction, individuals can find comfort and relaxation.
Incorporating crafting into our lives can positively impact our mental health and overall well-being. Engaging in creative and artistic hobbies enables individuals to find solace, foster mindfulness, boost self-esteem, develop social connections, and explore personal emotions. Crafting offers a unique way to care for our mental health, providing a fulfilling and enjoyable outlet for self-expression and stress relief. So, pick up that brush, thread, or clay, and discover the incredible benefits of crafting for wellness.","Can you tell me more about how individuals can tap into their subconscious mind to create art that reflects their emotional state, and how this process can lead to a greater sense of emotional awareness and well-being?"

"|Entering the Great Hall.
The Museum Director Arnold L. Lehman said, “For the very first time, our visitors have the opportunity to sample the breadth and depth of our holdings as they enter the Museum,” and the museum creates as impressive an entrance as possible, placing “Connecting Cultures” within four free-standing walls surrounded by a row of giant columns in the Great Hall. The space was previously home to a gallery of American Indian art, but the New York Times wrote, “The space never worked. Its parameters were vague, its sightlines blighted by clunky pillars.” Here, the pillars are used as a grand sort of frame, presenting “Connecting Cultures” as an embellished and classicized white cube with all the art shaken up within.
The visitor enters the exhibition space through the grand colonnaded entrance and greeted with what could very well be mistaken for a yard sale. There are so many items stacked on top of one another, paintings that are hung as high as ten feet, and every kind of object you can ever imagine. Walking through the space forces a sort of focus on individual pieces, but there are still so many options that each viewer is able to choose which ones they prefer to focus on and learn about. In the exhibition press release the Brooklyn Museum wrote, “The ‘Connecting Places’ section presents artworks that reflect the human fascination with the physical world around us and how it relates to spirituality,” and here there are giant landscape paintings, tribal animal masks, and tile mosaics, among countless other items. “Connecting People” on the other hand “investigates the ways in which human beings have represented themselves in artworks, in various cultures throughout time.” There is the obvious Picasso placed next to a more standard portrait, but also Gaston Lachaise’s phenomenally powerful “Standing Woman” from 1932 placed next to Abelam ancestral figures and Nigerian masks. Finally the “Connecting Things” section “includes work that carry particular significance to those who make a use them.” Obviously the most general section that includes vast collections of the same items like mirrors and pitchers, alongside smaller pairings of two or three similar items intended for comparison.
“Connecting Cultures” constantly juxtaposed objects with similar themes by placing them next to each other, forcing the viewer to determine their similarities and differences even though the two artifacts may have been made on opposite sides of the globe in completely different millennia. One of these most obvious comparisons came at the introduction to the “Connecting People” section of the exhibit. At the top of an L-shaped display arrangement that began on the very left side of the wall hung a painting from Peru in 1765, “Our Lady of Cocharcas” which depicts a pilgrimage during the time of the Spanish conversion and conquest of the Incas, when they allowed for the apparition of the Virgin statue at sites sacred to the locals as a way of easing them into accepting Christianity. Below this painting sits an 18th century statue of the Buddhist goddess of Dawn from China, and to its left hangs Chevalier Fereol de Bonnemaison’s “Young Woman Overtaken by a Storm” from 1799. It features an idealized representation of a young woman wrapped in sheer fabric that is blown about by the wind; the turbulence here was intended to evoke the instability left in the wake of the French Revolution. These three works were all made in the same century but on different continents, and all use the figure of a woman to represent a larger idea, whether that be the incoming of forced religious change, the spirit behind the dawn, or the vulnerability of a nation still recuperating. The Brooklyn Museum’s press release stated, “In viewing the juxtaposition and combination of works from different cultures around the world, the visitor will be asked to consider the importance of the idea of place to the definition of culture and the self; the ways in which people represent themselves in the works of art that help define them and the role of objects, or things, in supporting identity, both personal and cultural.”","What can be inferred about the relationship between a person's sense of place and their sense of self from the differing depictions of the female figure in ""Our Lady of Cocharcas"", ""The Buddhist Goddess of Dawn"", and ""Young Woman Overtaken by a Storm""?"

"I really enjoyed Dr. Kist’s lecture for he knew how to engage us in our learning through active participation. Instead of just talking to us through PowerPoint slides he got us to take part in our own learning. He didn’t just teach us about new literacy practices in the classroom but showed us. He kept us on our toes through the whole presentation because we didn’t know what to expect next. We were all confused in where these activities were going to lead as we threw paper balls at each other or lined up in the hallway. The activity was we all had to write down our favorite literary media on a piece of paper then crumple it up and throw it to someone around the room. Then the paper that we caught we had to respond to what was written. Then after two rounds we were asked to go to the hallway, and find the person whose paper you had. It was in a state of anticipation in what was going to happen next that kept us engaged through the whole presentation. Also learning was no longer just about listening to the teacher talk but it was about collaboration where we worked with other classmates. Kist made an excellent point about the importance of getting students to work with their peers. When their peers are the greatest influences and concerns in students’ lives what better way to get students engaged than to have them talk and work with one another. Kist also made you reconsider the possibilities of what the classroom could be like. At one point when everyone was talking to each other after lining up according to birthdays (another activity done in the hallway where we had to line up according to birthdays without talking) Kist stopped and said “this is what you want to hear in your classroom: talking and laughing among students.” It made you think about what the classroom could be like where learning becomes fun. In these activities we saw how using new literacies in the classroom could change the ways of teaching in which learning becomes exciting, engaging, and active. Furthermore I thought Kist made a good point when thinking about bringing “new literacies” in the classroom. In the previous lectures it was all about the moving image and incorporating film in to the classroom but Kist defined new literacies as any tool that promoted connectedness, community and collaboration. What made Kist a great teacher was that he shaped his lecture and teachings based on the interests and needs of his audience. When you center your teaching to connect to the experiences of the student you’ll get them engaged in their learning and empower them to do more.
Kist’s presentation made me think about my own teaching practices. As an art teacher I am always trying to re-engage students with new materials as they bring forth their lived experiences in to their art making. It is all about making connections and students make meaning by being able to connect their experiences with what they are learning in the classroom. When this connection is not made students are detached and disengaged in their learning. So in what different ways can we bring students’ experiences and their voice in to the classroom? As we learned from Kist that bringing new literacies in to the classroom is about “connectedness, community and collaboration,” thus I believe that the Arts is one of the most effective ways to achieve this. As we talked about using film and moving images in the classroom during this conference you can also expand to other art forms such as looking at paintings or sculptures as well as engaging in art-making. Within thinking about the theme of teach, think and play I provided some resources that might help you think about how the Arts bring these three components in to the classroom. I attached some readings that make ties between art, learning and the imagination. Also I provided some links where you can learn to incorporate art in to your teaching practices.

When their peers are the greatest influences and concerns in students’ lives what better way to get students engaged than to have them talk and work with one another. Kist also made you reconsider the possibilities of what the classroom could be like. At one point when everyone was talking to each other after lining up according to birthdays (another activity done in the hallway where we had to line up according to birthdays without talking) Kist stopped and said “this is what you want to hear in your classroom: talking and laughing among students.” It made you think about what the classroom could be like where learning becomes fun. In these activities we saw how using new literacies in the classroom could change the ways of teaching in which learning becomes exciting, engaging, and active. Furthermore I thought Kist made a good point when thinking about bringing “new literacies” in the classroom. In the previous lectures it was all about the moving image and incorporating film in to the classroom but Kist defined new literacies as any tool that promoted connectedness, community and collaboration. What made Kist a great teacher was that he shaped his lecture and teachings based on the interests and needs of his audience. When you center your teaching to connect to the experiences of the student you’ll get them engaged in their learning and empower them to do more.
Kist’s presentation made me think about my own teaching practices. As an art teacher I am always trying to re-engage students with new materials as they bring forth their lived experiences in to their art making. It is all about making connections and students make meaning by being able to connect their experiences with what they are learning in the classroom. When this connection is not made students are detached and disengaged in their learning. So in what different ways can we bring students’ experiences and their voice in to the classroom? As we learned from Kist that bringing new literacies in to the classroom is about “connectedness, community and collaboration,” thus I believe that the Arts is one of the most effective ways to achieve this. As we talked about using film and moving images in the classroom during this conference you can also expand to other art forms such as looking at paintings or sculptures as well as engaging in art-making. Within thinking about the theme of teach, think and play I provided some resources that might help you think about how the Arts bring these three components in to the classroom. I attached some readings that make ties between art, learning and the imagination. Also I provided some links where you can learn to incorporate art in to your teaching practices.

They are really interesting.","How can a teacher effectively use a multimedia presentation to convey the importance of community and connection in learning, while also incorporating the arts and encouraging active participation among students?"
"I really enjoyed Dr. Kist’s lecture for he knew how to engage us in our learning through active participation. Instead of just talking to us through PowerPoint slides he got us to take part in our own learning. He didn’t just teach us about new literacy practices in the classroom but showed us. He kept us on our toes through the whole presentation because we didn’t know what to expect next. We were all confused in where these activities were going to lead as we threw paper balls at each other or lined up in the hallway. The activity was we all had to write down our favorite literary media on a piece of paper then crumple it up and throw it to someone around the room. Then the paper that we caught we had to respond to what was written. Then after two rounds we were asked to go to the hallway, and find the person whose paper you had. It was in a state of anticipation in what was going to happen next that kept us engaged through the whole presentation. Also learning was no longer just about listening to the teacher talk but it was about collaboration where we worked with other classmates.

"2. Artistic and Moral Experience
1 January 1915, Dornach
The understanding of the spiritual-scientific view of life not merely with the mind but with the heart has as a result a corresponding revolution in artistic creation and enjoyment. The forces which we derive from this world-outlook can also flow into the understanding of the world from the point of view of Art. We have recently tried to indicate with our building (the Goetheanum at Dornach) at least a small part of the spiritual-scientific impulses which can flow into artistic forms. We would see a time, before us, if we examine closely the experiences and feelings to be derived from spiritual science, when the path to Art would be in many respects different from what it has been in the past, when the means of artistic creation will be experienced in the human soul much more intensively than before, when colours and sounds will be much more intimately felt in the soul, when, as it were, colours and sounds can be felt morally and spiritually in the soul, and when in the creations of the artists we shall meet the traces of their souls' experiences in the Cosmos.
In essentials the attitude of artistic creation and artistic appreciation in the past epoch was a kind of external observation, an appeal to something that affects the artist from outside. The need to refer to Nature and to the model for outward observation has become greater and greater. Not that in the Art of the future there is to be any one-sided rejection of Nature and outward reality. Far from it, but there will be a much more intimate union with the external world; so strong a union with it, that it covers not merely the external impression of colours and sound and form, but that which one can experience behind the sound and colour and form, in what is revealed by them.
In this respect mankind will make important discoveries in the future; it will unite its moral-spiritual nature with the results of sense-perception. An endless deepening of the human soul can be foreseen in this domain. Let us take first of all a single point. We will take the case when we direct our gaze to a surface evenly covered with vermilion. Let us assume we succeed in forgetting everything else round us and concentrating entirely on experiencing this colour, so that we have the colour in front of us not merely as something that works upon us, but as something wherein we ourselves are, with which we ourselves are one. We shall then be able to have the experience: you are now in the world, you yourself have become colour in this world, your innermost soul has become colour. Wherever you go in the world, your soul will be filled with red, everywhere you live in red and with red and out of red. But we will not be able to experience this in intensive soul-life, unless the feeling is transformed into the corresponding moral experience, into real moral experience. If we float through the world as red, and have become identical with red, we shall not be able to help feeling that this red world in which one is oneself red is pierced with the substance of divine wrath, which pours upon us from every direction on account of all the possibilities of evil and sin in us. We shall be able to feel we are in the illimitable red spaces as in a judgment court of God, and our moral feelings will be like what a moral experience of our soul would become in all-embracing “illimitable” space. Then when the reaction comes, when something rises in our soul one can only describe it by saying that one learns to pray.
If one can experience in the colour red the radiation and fusion of the divine wrath with all that can lie in the soul as the possibility of evil, and if one can experience in red how one learns to pray, then the experience of the colour red is enormously deepened. Then we can also experience how red can express itself plastically in space.
We can then understand how we can experience a Being who radiates goodness, who is filled with divine goodness and mercy, a Being such as we long to experience in space. Then we shall feel the need of expressing this divine mercy and goodness in a form which arises out of the colour itself. We shall feel the need of allowing space to recede, so that the goodness and mercy may shine forth. As clouds are driven asunder so space is rent by goodness and mercy and we shall get the feeling: you must make that a red which is fleeing.","How would a spiritual-scientific artist, familiar with the concept of divine wrath and its relationship with human morality, approach the creation of a piece that reflects the experience of living with a chronic and debilitating illness?"

We can then understand how we can experience a Being who radiates goodness, who is filled with divine goodness and mercy, a Being such as we long to experience in space. Then we shall feel the need of expressing this divine mercy and goodness in a form which arises out of the colour itself. We shall feel the need of allowing space to recede, so that the goodness and mercy may shine forth. As clouds are driven asunder so space is rent by goodness and mercy and we shall get the feeling: you must make that a red which is fleeing.","Can you describe a scenario where an artist's soul is so deeply connected to the divine that it becomes a manifestation of the divine in the world, much like the experience of praying in the context of the color red?"
"2. Artistic and Moral Experience
1 January 1915, Dornach
The understanding of the spiritual-scientific view of life not merely with the mind but with the heart has as a result a corresponding revolution in artistic creation and enjoyment. The forces which we derive from this world-outlook can also flow into the understanding of the world from the point of view of Art. We have recently tried to indicate with our building (the Goetheanum at Dornach) at least a small part of the spiritual-scientific impulses which can flow into artistic forms. We would see a time, before us, if we examine closely the experiences and feelings to be derived from spiritual science, when the path to Art would be in many respects different from what it has been in the past, when the means of artistic creation will be experienced in the human soul much more intensively than before, when colours and sounds will be much more intimately felt in the soul, when, as it were, colours and sounds can be felt morally and spiritually in the soul, and when in the creations of the artists we shall meet the traces of their souls' experiences in the Cosmos.
In essentials the attitude of artistic creation and artistic appreciation in the past epoch was a kind of external observation, an appeal to something that affects the artist from outside. The need to refer to Nature and to the model for outward observation has become greater and greater. Not that in the Art of the future there is to be any one-sided rejection of Nature and outward reality. Far from it, but there will be a much more intimate union with the external world; so strong a union with it, that it covers not merely the external impression of colours and sound and form, but that which one can experience behind the sound and colour and form, in what is revealed by them.
In this respect mankind will make important discoveries in the future; it will unite its moral-spiritual nature with the results of sense-perception. An endless deepening of the human soul can be foreseen in this domain. Let us take first of all a single point. We will take the case when we direct our gaze to a surface evenly covered with vermilion. Let us assume we succeed in forgetting everything else round us and concentrating entirely on experiencing this colour, so that we have the colour in front of us not merely as something that works upon us, but as something wherein we ourselves are, with which we ourselves are one. We shall then be able to have the experience: you are now in the world, you yourself have become colour in this world, your innermost soul has become colour. Wherever you go in the world, your soul will be filled with red, everywhere you live in red and with red and out of red. But we will not be able to experience this in intensive soul-life, unless the feeling is transformed into the corresponding moral experience, into real moral experience. If we float through the world as red, and have become identical with red, we shall not be able to help feeling that this red world in which one is oneself red is pierced with the substance of divine wrath, which pours upon us from every direction on account of all the possibilities of evil and sin in us. We shall be able to feel we are in the illimitable red spaces as in a judgment court of God, and our moral feelings will be like what a moral experience of our soul would become in all-embracing “illimitable” space. Then when the reaction comes, when something rises in our soul one can only describe it by saying that one learns to pray.
If one can experience in the colour red the radiation and fusion of the divine wrath with all that can lie in the soul as the possibility of evil, and if one can experience in red how one learns to pray, then the experience of the colour red is enormously deepened. Then we can also experience how red can express itself plastically in space.
We can then understand how we can experience a Being who radiates goodness, who is filled with divine goodness and mercy, a Being such as we long to experience in space. Then we shall feel the need of expressing this divine mercy and goodness in a form which arises out of the colour itself. We shall feel the need of allowing space to recede, so that the goodness and mercy may shine forth. As clouds are driven asunder so space is rent by goodness and mercy and we shall get the feeling: you must make that a red which is fleeing.",How does the experience of divine wrath and its relation to human soul influence the artist's creative process when attempting to capture the essence of divine goodness and mercy in a painting?

"In the late 19th century, a revolutionary art movement emerged in France, forever changing the landscape of painting. French Impressionism, characterized by its emphasis on capturing fleeting moments and the play of light and color, shattered traditional artistic conventions and gave birth to a new era of artistic expression. This article explores the origins, key characteristics, and influential masters of French Impressionism, offering a glimpse into this captivating artistic revolution.
The Birth of Impressionism
At the heart of Impressionism lies a group of rebellious artists who sought to break free from the rigid standards set by the French Academy of Fine Arts. Led by luminaries such as Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and Edgar Degas, these artists aimed to capture the essence of a scene rather than its meticulous details. Their works were marked by loose brushwork, vibrant colors, and a focus on natural light. The term “Impressionism” itself was coined in 1874, when Monet exhibited his groundbreaking painting, “Impression, Sunrise,” which epitomized the movement’s core principles.
Capturing the Essence of Light
One of the defining characteristics of Impressionism is the artists’ preoccupation with capturing the ever-changing effects of light and its interplay with the surrounding environment. Monet, regarded as the master of light, dedicated his career to studying the shifting nuances of color and luminosity. His series of paintings featuring water lilies, haystacks, and the Rouen Cathedral are iconic examples of his ability to evoke a sense of atmosphere and mood through his brushstrokes.
Everyday Life as Art
In contrast to the grand historical and mythological subjects favored by the Academy, Impressionists turned their attention to the everyday world around them. They sought inspiration in modern urban life, leisure activities, and scenes of ordinary people engaged in mundane tasks. Renoir, known for his celebration of human sensuality, portrayed joyous scenes of boating parties, bustling cafes, and dancing at the Moulin de la Galette. His brushwork, infused with warmth and vitality, brought the viewer into the heart of these vibrant moments.
The Influence of Japanese Art
The opening of trade between Japan and the West in the mid-19th century had a profound impact on the Impressionist movement. Japanese woodblock prints, with their flattened perspective, unusual angles, and focus on everyday life, captivated the Impressionists. They adopted these elements in their own works, resulting in innovative compositions and a fresh perspective. Mary Cassatt, an American artist who became an integral part of the Impressionist circle, incorporated elements of Japanese art into her depictions of mothers and children, creating intimate and tender portrayals.
Degas and the Ballet
Edgar Degas, renowned for his fascination with ballet, infused his work with a sense of movement, grace, and behind-the-scenes glimpses of the dancers’ lives. His paintings, pastels, and sculptures captured the dynamic energy of the ballet studio and the fleeting moments on stage. Degas’ unconventional compositions and unusual cropping of figures provided a unique perspective that challenged traditional notions of framing and composition.
The Enduring Legacy: French Impressionism’s Revolutionary Impact on Art
French Impressionism revolutionized the art world, ushering in a new era of artistic freedom, experimentation, and innovation. Through their emphasis on capturing the fleeting nature of light and their exploration of everyday life, Impressionist masters such as Monet, Renoir, and Degas forever altered the course of art history. Their works continue to captivate audiences worldwide, inviting us to see the world through their revolutionary lens and appreciate the beauty in the fleeting moments that surround us. French Impressionism remains a testament to the unprecedented power of art to challenge norms, evoke emotions, and inspire generations of artists to come. The legacy of French Impressionism is not only seen in the works of its influential masters but also in the countless artists who continue to draw inspiration from their bold brushstrokes and innovative techniques. French Impressionism remains a testament to the enduring impact of artistic revolution and the timeless beauty it can create.","What is the primary way in which Monet's composition of his water lily series reflects the ephemeral nature of the subject, and how does this composition technique differ from traditional approaches to landscape painting?"

"In the late 19th century, a revolutionary art movement emerged in France, forever changing the landscape of painting. French Impressionism, characterized by its emphasis on capturing fleeting moments and the play of light and color, shattered traditional artistic conventions and gave birth to a new era of artistic expression. This article explores the origins, key characteristics, and influential masters of French Impressionism, offering a glimpse into this captivating artistic revolution.
The Birth of Impressionism
At the heart of Impressionism lies a group of rebellious artists who sought to break free from the rigid standards set by the French Academy of Fine Arts. Led by luminaries such as Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and Edgar Degas, these artists aimed to capture the essence of a scene rather than its meticulous details. Their works were marked by loose brushwork, vibrant colors, and a focus on natural light. The term “Impressionism” itself was coined in 1874, when Monet exhibited his groundbreaking painting, “Impression, Sunrise,” which epitomized the movement’s core principles.
Capturing the Essence of Light
One of the defining characteristics of Impressionism is the artists’ preoccupation with capturing the ever-changing effects of light and its interplay with the surrounding environment. Monet, regarded as the master of light, dedicated his career to studying the shifting nuances of color and luminosity. His series of paintings featuring water lilies, haystacks, and the Rouen Cathedral are iconic examples of his ability to evoke a sense of atmosphere and mood through his brushstrokes.
Everyday Life as Art
In contrast to the grand historical and mythological subjects favored by the Academy, Impressionists turned their attention to the everyday world around them. They sought inspiration in modern urban life, leisure activities, and scenes of ordinary people engaged in mundane tasks. Renoir, known for his celebration of human sensuality, portrayed joyous scenes of boating parties, bustling cafes, and dancing at the Moulin de la Galette. His brushwork, infused with warmth and vitality, brought the viewer into the heart of these vibrant moments.
The Influence of Japanese Art
The opening of trade between Japan and the West in the mid-19th century had a profound impact on the Impressionist movement. Japanese woodblock prints, with their flattened perspective, unusual angles, and focus on everyday life, captivated the Impressionists. They adopted these elements in their own works, resulting in innovative compositions and a fresh perspective. Mary Cassatt, an American artist who became an integral part of the Impressionist circle, incorporated elements of Japanese art into her depictions of mothers and children, creating intimate and tender portrayals.
Degas and the Ballet

"Another popular work of art is known as the Tyche of Antioch, made by Eutychides, which served as an exemplary framework for creating the images of different Greek goddesses.
Tyche also shares a depiction with Demeter in her temple at Thebes. In this temple, she is shown holding the infant Plutus in her arms, representing her endless control and power to offer abundance and riches.
The Different Depictions of Tyche
In the Parthian empire, which was ruled by Vologases I, the son of Vonnones II, Tyche’s imagery was represented on all the Greek coins used back in the day and this supremacy of imagery on Parthian coinage went on for almost 200 years.
She reserved the right to appear on most Hellenistic coins for about three hundred years.
Tyche is also depicted as the constellation of the zodiac sign, Virgo along with Demeter and Astraea.
Apollo, the classical Greek god of truth, healing, dance, and music, is believed to have directed and instructed Tyche symbolizing the fact that Tyche even heavily influenced the will of gods. One of the famous Greek playwrights and dramatists, Euripides, used Tyche in his stories to add aesthetics and hint at major themes and meanings for a stronger representation of ideas.
Tyche as a goddess of fate is even depicted in several poems written by Pindar. According to him, goddess Tyche has complete authority over the final results of various events and competitions in Athletics.
Tyche was also worshipped at Pharae in Messenia, located at Smyrna. Her statue was created by Bupalus with the world or the globe on her head supported by one of her hands. The other hand is shown holding the horn of Amalthea.
In the art of Sicyon situated in Achaia, Tyche was represented with the horn of Amalthea. There is another piece of art representing the winged god Eros along with Tvche located in Elis at Thebes.
In Roman mythology, she is called Fortuna and is depicted as someone wearing a military armor dress and a mural crown. The mural crown was a peculiar headpiece representing the protective walls of the city. It served as an emblem of the goddesses responsible for keeping an eye out on the city.
In the depiction of Tyche of Antioch, the Orontes river is shown at her feet in the form of a male swimmer. This further strengthens her existence as an Oceanid in Greek mythology.
Note – The mural crown of Tyche symbolizes that she is the prime goddess and protector of the city, Sparta. Her crown also depicted the foundation of the city. Several artists have been inspired by the artwork created in Ancient Greece and Rome based on Tyche and her different representations.
According to Matheson, the Goddess Tyche, being one of the Oceanids, is considered to be an ocean goddess of some kind. Citing how Pindar refers to her in his poems, “he implores her to keep watch around Himera, a port,” and how she is often depicted holding a ship’s rudder.
From the Fables
Zeus ordered Tyche to show the mortals the two ways of life: the way of freedom and the way of slavery. The initial path to achieve freedom was made hard and bumpy by Prometheus, with no water anywhere to drink and steep pathways full of dangers.
However, over time with a persisted journey along the path, the terrain gradually gets smoother and easier, adorned with water bodies and fruit trees on the sides. This means that the whole experience and pain of conquering impassable routes is worth it. And those who manage to successfully ace this difficult journey get to breathe the air of freedom.
The way of slavery is said to begin with zero hardships. It is a pleasant road with all the resources available in the surroundings for the mortals to live a comfortable, almost luxurious life. But in the end, the journey becomes overwhelming as the path gets harder and unassailable.
Another story goes this way – a farmer plowing his field accidentally stumbles upon a treasure of gold for which he thanks the goddess earth Gaea and, to honor her, erects an altar dedicated to her. Goddess Tyche, upon witnessing the farmer rejoicing in his riches, feeling disappointed that she was not given equal respect and veneration, appears in front of the ungrateful farmer and warns him about his future. She tells him that he would be the first person to turn to her temple for help once all the gold and wealth he found gets stolen.

Besides identifying the interconnectedness of dreams in his personalized dream journal, he continues to study the significance of celestial objects and their relation to mythological tales that keep modern society intrigued about past civilizations.","What role did the concept of fate play in the development of female characters in ancient Greek tragedy, and how did Euripides' portrayal of women reflect this concept?"

From the Fables
Zeus ordered Tyche to show the mortals the two ways of life: the way of freedom and the way of slavery. The initial path to achieve freedom was made hard and bumpy by Prometheus, with no water anywhere to drink and steep pathways full of dangers.
However, over time with a persisted journey along the path, the terrain gradually gets smoother and easier, adorned with water bodies and fruit trees on the sides. This means that the whole experience and pain of conquering impassable routes is worth it. And those who manage to successfully ace this difficult journey get to breathe the air of freedom.
The way of slavery is said to begin with zero hardships. It is a pleasant road with all the resources available in the surroundings for the mortals to live a comfortable, almost luxurious life. But in the end, the journey becomes overwhelming as the path gets harder and unassailable.

Goddess Tyche, upon witnessing the farmer rejoicing in his riches, feeling disappointed that she was not given equal respect and veneration, appears in front of the ungrateful farmer and warns him about his future. She tells him that he would be the first person to turn to her temple for help once all the gold and wealth he found gets stolen.
